# Dynamo

Implementation of DYNAMO on which the 'Limits To Growth' model was run.

In this repo there an HTML page has a menu that processes a Dynamo Card Deck.  This implementation is specified by the original Dynamo manual which has been reproduced under the book icon.  

Current status is proof of concept.  Only mathematical functions needed to run the example card deck on page 17 of the included manual are implemented at this time.  The upload icon on the far left has a menu with and entry labeled 'default' to load this example.  The video which plays under the rose icon shows the menu functions being used.

More work and documentation is intended.  Currently the included manual under the book icon and a knowledge of Javascript should be enough for someone interested to figure out what I am doing.

The ultimate goal is to obtain a version of the card deck which ran the original 'Limits to Growth' model and include that with the default choice in the file load manual.

Current focus will be on implementing all the mathematical functions defined in the maual which are not yet implemented.
