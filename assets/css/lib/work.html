<p class="brownFont">The new Doomstead Forum is up.  Last week I did not put up a link to the forum, but the forum has members and is being posted in.  Here is the link to the <a  class="redFont" style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://chasingthesquirrel.com/doomstead/index.php">Doomstead.</a>  I am working on custom artwork for the forum page.</p>
<p class="brownFont">I have the idea of constructing a virtual Diner as a 3-D model.  Rendering it as a high resolution photo which can be zoomed in on to read a menu lying on a counter through a window.</p>
<p class="brownFont">An ambitious idea, Now I experience the obstacle to my goal becomes the way to achieve my goal.  I will build the model in 'Blender'.  But first I have to learn it.  That will take a while.  I watch tutorials and nod out.</p>
<p class="brownFont">Zooming in on a picture is much easier.  The file for this picture is 6000 pixels wide.</p>
<p class="brownFont"><center><img src="./public/pics/nighthawks.jpg" alt="image" width="300"></center></p>  
<p class="brownFont">I wrote code to use a mouse or up down arrows to zoom.  So far my code only zooms.  Later I hope to pan with click and drag.</p>
<p class="brownFont"><center><img src="./public/pics/zoomed.png" alt="image" width="300"></center></p>  
<p class="brownFont">For now, the old Doomstead Diner Logo will do.  It will be weeks before a new one is ready.  That is fine.  In a virtual sense, RE still walks the halls.  The old logo is not out of place.  I just tested my link to the new Doomstead.  RE just made a post.</p>
<p class="brownFont">I tried to watch the news this week, but all I  encountered was war and violence.  Watching Blender tutorials is better than disgust at the emotional fear porn of daily news.  Even if I nod  out doing it.  Never has the lack of meaningful info been more clear.  Or the  preponderance of outright lies by daily news been more stark.</p>
<p class="brownFont">After a long journey.  Voltaire has Candide settle in the outskirts of Constantinople.  To '<i>tend his own garden</i>'. To mind his own business.  Witnessing the horror, intolerance and ephemeral truth of human affairs.  Candide decides that the best thing to do in the world is settle down to a quiet, peaceful life.  Enjoying neighbors, and giving something of value to others.</p>
<p class="brownFont">'<i>Neither need you tell me,</i>' said Candide, '<i>that we must take care of our garden.</i>'</p>
<p class="brownFont">'<i>You are in the right,</i>' said Pangloss; '<i>for when man was put into the garden of Eden, it was with an intent to dress it: and this proves that man was not born to be idle.</i>' '<i>Work then without disputing,</i>' said Martin; '<i>it is the only way to render life supportable.</i>'</p>
<p class="brownFont">The impediment to action advances action. What stands in the way becomes the way.  Blender is hard to learn, but what people can do with it is amazing.  Learning it will be useful for other things.</p>
