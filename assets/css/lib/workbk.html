<article id="ART081222" class="commentbox">
<div class="article_date">Friday August 12th 2022</div>
<div class="oliveFont article_title">The Steal</div>
<p class="oliveFont">I am not a fan of the <a class="redFont" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://www.hamptonthink.org/read/the-fbis-war-on-the-left-a-short-history-of-cointelpro">FBI</a>.  The American Gestapo.  There are things I can type on this webpage that bring a response.  The response is having links on my page remapped to go somewhere else.  It happens, not many links, and so far, not for long.  The link destinations send me a clear and personal message that betrays survellance.  Transparent clear personalized manipulation.  Leaving the source of the message beyond any doubt.  The link destinations give it away.  Men in suits, Fascism Lite, the new brand.  Phone surveillance part of the package.  The <a class="redFont" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://www.rt.com/usa/dummy-website-wannabe-terrorist-arrested-356/">FBI</a> is Ok with this arrangement.  They must be or they would stop it.  If they don't stop it they have to be involved in it.  The activities and money spent for surveillance have to be accounted for and the billions in money must be spent.</p>
<p class="oliveFont">Comments I make on You-Tube are often deleted regardless of what I say.  Is one a day often?  Who set up that arrangement?  The speed at which I am censored shows dedicated attention.  More than Google would do on their own.  And Google is not who messes with my phone.  Messing with my phone came first.</p>
<p class="oliveFont">But the raid on Trump, I have to say, good job there <a class="redFont" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Hollies/_/Long+Cool+Woman+(In+a+Black+Dress)+(2003+Digital+Remaster)">FBI</a>.  I have had to Trump Trump Trump news all my life.  I have never liked the Trump self-promotion circus.  Golden circus poster hair, the Trump face.  The smirk.  It never goes away.  Snake oil.  I did not like his phony self-promotion when Trump put flower-child airs.  Before Trump built anything at all he put on flower child airs.  He only did this for a day, back when all Trump had was daddy money and grand-daddy secrets.  Trump only talked about his NYC development plans then, he had not built anything yet.  Trump was in his early 20s,  I was 14.  I lived in Minneapolis far away, but a skinny real-estate rag magazine somehow found me.  It was maybe six pages long.  It featured an up-and-coming genius, Donald Trump.  A genius who would change the world.  Spreading peace and love by owning and developing real estate.  A new twist on peace and love.  A new paradigm.  It made me sick.</p> 
<p class="oliveFont">I had a few year reprieve.  But Trump self-promotion came back, as it always does.  I don't think I was doing anything to deserve it, but Trump came back to torture me.  Trump became the 'greed is good' poster boy for the narcissistic 80s and 90s.  Getting every picture of his extravagant conspicuously consumptive social dancing ass published that he could.  Part of 'society', Trump's shallow ass became an icon of success.  It made me sick.</p>
<p class="oliveFont">Trump leveraged his finances to oblivion.  Success, success and more success,  a climb like Icarus, and then crash.  Atlantic City and crash.  A bad gamble, a lot of angry people who did not get paid.  Some with kids.  Trump's helicopter continued to fly.  Consequences rearranged.  The art of the steal.</p>
<p class="oliveFont">Reality TV came along to rescue a fortune lost in Atlantic City.  Reality TV idiots, swayed by Trump flim-flam, thinking Trump jet-setting reality was real.  Graduates of Trump University in their own heads.  The deluded who made Trump president.  Trump went on to ruin the country and take a big payday.  Ignoring melting wings, the secret of Trump success.  Trump thought he could get by with white house good times for another four years.  Another four years of national neglect and Covid-19 death.  Another four years of Trump cronies squeezing all the oil we have out of our rock.  It will be good when the Trump dog day is done.  When Trump can't come back like he always does.  So good job <a class="redFont" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XULIO67YIRA">FBI</a>.  Get the nuclear secrets and silverware back.  Along with whatever else Trump stole.</p>
<p class="oliveFont">Europe baked in a heat wave last month.  France dried out and caught fire.  Rivers there run dry.  More than 300 people died from heat in Spain.  Half of Europe is in drought, the worst drought in 500 years.  Drought is devastating crops all over the Northern Hemisphere.  Texas has a record dry spell.  In parts of Italy, farmers lose up to 80% of their harvest.  If they go broke, somebody is ready to buy their land.  I am sure.  Bill Gates buys land and homes rent here now because houses cost too much to buy.  Gasoline a gallon cost is getting to be on par with the federal minimum wage.  Commutes for some Americans become impossible.  Inflation rises with the summer heat along with mass shootings.  The <a class="redFont" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://youtu.be/pe5il37e7lU">FBI</a> shot a man dead in Ohio today.  A crazy man.  Crazy men get shot dead in America.  Butterfly netting the crazy only happens in cartoons and children's stories.  Actual crazy people are given consequences only a sane person in medieval Europe could understand.  Attacking a building with a nail gun should get a tranquilizer dart.  That is not an option.  That is never an option.</p>
<p class="oliveFont">With our cornucopia of problems, what do 'progressive' people do?  They speak of the horror of mask mandates and the loss of rights.  Somebody stole their cheese.  They complain but do nothing.  Everybody is out to lunch.  Progressives think the vax kills, lives saved by it are ignored.  The economy of China fails, and Chinese bank accounts freeze.  Jets over heads.  Stories of Taiwan and mainland invasion fill American news.  Death in Ukraine affects Americans as much as Wile E. Coyote dying in a Road Runner cartoon.  Generations of American news hating on Russia bring people together in a twisted way.  An evil to point at.  Fingers need to point at something so suffering and death is ignored.  Three fingers point back.</p>
<p class="oliveFont">Few people understand limits are reached.  Growth as Americans have understood it to be is over.  Growth depended on easy to get resources the Earth no longer has in abundance.  But making steady-state arrangements has no appeal.</p>
<p class="oliveFont">The American government prepares for war.  All mainstream media demonize Putin and 'his' Ukraine war.  Fear is used to ignore real concerns.  Mass media does not talk about American job losses, inflation, or Covid-19 death.  Instead, talk of Taiwan invasion piggybacks on top of Putin war fear.  But the effect on the 'supply chain' would not be good for China if they invaded Taiwan.  China needs to sell.  War makes commerce inconvenient.  Who thinks of this?</p>
<p class="oliveFont">Evil Russians will bomb a nuclear power plant in Ukraine any minute says American news.  A summer of distraction.  If the world survives another decade, perhaps that is how these times will be described.  A crescendo of climate and economic disasters ignored to keep existing arrangements intact. Crazy times.  Money continues to do what it does without restraint or human intervention.</p>
<p class="oliveFont">One definition of insanity, there are many definitions of insanity.  Is not living according to circumstances.  Circumstances being the world as it actually is and not what fantasy says it is or what you want it to be. Crazy is living in a way that denies reality.  Crazy is looking for easy answers to hard problems, ignoring reality by so doing.  Not learning or dealing and through ignorance attracting unnecessary pain, is crazy.  Making the same bad choice over and over again.  One of the other definitions of crazy.  That is what not learning from mistakes does.</p>
<p class="oliveFont">We live in crazy times.</p>

<p class="pinkFont"><div style="width:280px;float:left;padding: 6px 0 0 0;"><img src="./public/pics/ifyoubuildit.png" style="width:250px;" title="If You Build it" alt="Field of Dreams"></div>
<p class="pinkFont">Last week, only Dogchat (<i>on my right sidebar</i>) worked.  Now comments below my articles work.</p><p class="pinkFont">A Dogchat user can comment on what I write now.  The 'Comments' button below this article works.  Clicking on a reply button or double-clicking on a comment brings up an editor.  Dogchat users can edit their own comments.  Dogchat was a vehicle to get registration of users working on this website.  Comments below my articles was my real goal.</p>
<p class="pinkFont">No, you can't use your Google Identity here.  Are you kidding?</p>
<p class="pinkFont">It feels good.  I have no users yet, but last night my code for comments started working.  The only user I had vanished when I changed the way passwords hash.  I changed password hashing when I made email registration work.
<p class="pinkFont">Hopi Change come back!  You are only deleted because I made technical changes.  Now I have no real users at all.  I only have cartoon characters I use for test.</p>
<p class="pinkFont">It feels good to have a website people can comment on where I control comments.  This is not a power thing for me.  It is a freedom thing for me.  Corporations control internet communication, but I have communication without corporate control.  I have this because I did it myself.  No mysterious third party controls and censors comments here.  As I polish what I have done, I will create a template for others to use.  I have a weapon against censorship.  I can say what I fucking want and I want others to be able to do the same.  Here is a reason doing this is important:</p>
<p class="pinkFont"><a class="redFont" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://www.mintpressnews.com/facebook-fact-checking-organizations-ukraine-funded-washington/281618/">"Most of the fact-checking organizations Facebook has partnered with to monitor and regulate information about Ukraine are directly funded by the U.S. government, either through the U.S. Embassy or via the notorious National Endowment for Democracy (NED)."</a></p>
<p class="pinkFont">I do not do Facebook, but Facebook is only one example of corporate/government control.  One of many examples.  You do not get one without the other.  Corporations owning the government is one reason for this.  There are others.  You disagree?  Then please leave a comment and tell me.</p>
<p class="pinkFont">My censorship is from the Alphabet Inc./government paring.  Comments I leave on Google platforms are frequently and mysteriously deleted.</p>
<p class="pinkFont">It has been an intense month getting hundreds of lines of code to work perfectly, and my job is not done.  This website is a work in progress.  There is work, and my editor has issues.  I also want users to be able to post pictures with their comments.  But my editor now works, and a logged-in user can post and edit comments.  Click a reply button to see my editor.  Or double-click on a comment.  You can edit a comment, but comments do not save if you are not logged-in and the owner of the comment you are trying to edit.  My editor has been working here for about 12 hours.</p>
<p class="pinkFont">With comments working, I can spend more time being literary.  I may not get users, but I made it possible for people to respond to what I write.  This is good.  Problems can't have solutions or things learned without communication.  Writing with comments will be better.</p>
<p class="pinkFont">If I write to a void.  I will find out.  I built it, but they do not come, why?  Time will tell.  If my globe has been a light show to keep me distracted, I will find out.</p>
<p class="pinkFont">* Logged-out dogs who double-click on a comment or who hit a reply button now see a message saying: 'You must log-in to edit' in an editor message bar.  Something like that.  I have changed the wording a few times.  The message is better than the silent fail I started with.  What I have now is more dog friendly.</p>

<article id="ART072922" class="commentbox">
<div class="article_date">Friday July 29th 2022</div>
<div class="wheatFont article_title">Going Up</div>
<p class="wheatFont">Food shortages, global economic crisis, refugees, corn-pone reactionary populists.  Human strife goes up with the concentration of CO2 in the air.  The concentration I track in the upper right-hand corner of this web page.  As the concentration rises, so do these problems.</p>
<p class="wheatFont">There is nothing to be done.  The problems are too big to fix, and the problems are understood by too few.  The limits of the earth are reached.  There is nowhere to go to hide.</p>
<p class="wheatFont">Living a simple meaningful life, the only solution to the current predicament, does not satisfy.  If it did, would we not already be on this path?</p>
<p class="wheatFont">There is a chaotic, explosive character to human history, so maybe not.  Taking existing circumstances as proof of certainty is not good.  Existing circumstances are only the possibility of what happened expressed.  An example of many possibilities that might have been.  These possibilities of what might have been make the current predicament tragic.</p>
<p class="wheatFont">Radical change to low carbon lifestyles.  Choosing to not grow population.  Biochar.  These are ways to do salvation, one of the possibilities of what could have been, but salvation will not be done.  It is not a choice.  Desire for money and a religion of efficiency puts humanity solid on a path to doom.  Desire for more is not low carbon lifestyle.  Radical, systemic change is the only way to avoid ruin.  But money prevents necessary change.  Money controls what people do.  Greed prevails and investment prefers keeping things the same.</p>
<p class="wheatFont">Money piles grow as if alive.  But not being alive, money attracts people to give money life.  People give money life.  Life likes to grow with single-minded ambition.  With a life of its own money is at odds with human survival.</p>
<p class="wheatFont">Thinking that they are owners of money, and not owned by it, owners of money always want 'their' money pile bigger.  Always a desire for more prevails.  Other considerations are not allowed.  Other considerations are in time defeated.  Profit is king, so who is the real boss?  Money owns the owner.</p>
<p class="wheatFont">Radical, systemic change never produces profit.</p>
<p class="wheatFont">I make sweeping generalizations, I know.  My generalizations describe collective action, not specifics.  Collective action is what makes CO2 concentration in the air go up.  Increasing CO2 in the air dooms humanity.  It is as simple as that.</p>
<p class="wheatFont">The details one gets easily lost in.  The forest cannot be seen through the trees.  The details are a quagmire.  The big picture is my CO2 concentration in the top right of this page goes up, and never down.</p>
<p class="wheatFont">It is this simple.  Light is absorbed by fog.  If someone shines a light at you and there is enough fog, you can't see the light.  You already know this.  A beam of light is scattered and absorbed by fog.  Where it is absorbed, it becomes heat.  But not enough heat so you will notice.  If you understand this, you can understand what CO2 does in the air.</p>
<p class="wheatFont">The sun sends light to earth, only part of which we can see.  That which we can see is not blocked by CO2.  The air is clear to visible light.  Much of light that we can't see is blocked as if by fog.  Light we can't see is infrared light.  Infrared light scatters and is absorbed by CO2.  Heat on the earths surface can't escape to space easily because CO2 blocks radiated heat.  Radiated heat is the same thing as infrared light.  Hot objects glow with infrared light that people can't see.  CO2 scatters and absorbs radiated heat, making air warmer.  Enough so you notice.  The sun is more than a flashlight.</p>
<p class="wheatFont">Visible light is not always reflected when it strikes the earth.  Visible light absorbed, becomes heat.  Which CO2 prevents the escape of.  More CO2, more heat.</p>
<p class="wheatFont">Energy from the sun is always radiated away from the earth as heat or reflected light.  What comes in goes out.  A balance is kept.  As the earth warms from absorbing energy from the sun.  Heat radiates away to keep the solar energy flow in balance.  More CO2 in the air means more energy captured before it is radiated away.  Temperature rises to keep in-out energy flow balance correct.</p>
<p class="wheatFont">Simple stuff, but nobody cares.  Again, a generalization that only in the collective is right.</p>

<p class="wheatFont">"Some, not many do not consider the pursuit of pleasure to be the most important thing in life.</p>
<p class="wheatFont">Yesterday I drove by a hole where a mall is being replaced by a giant apartment building.  Two enormous red cranes rose up over the road at opposite sides of the hole.  From the cranes suspended on a weighted line were two huge American flags.  They were thirty feet or so in size the short way.</p>
<p class="wheatFont">The cranes were beautiful, freshly painted and the Stars and Stripes bright and clean.  The effect was chilling.  Superman red against a Superman blue sky.  Nuremberg must have been this way.  Burning man is this way.</p>
<p class="wheatFont">Dominating raw power in a display hundreds of feet high that humbled everyone passing by.</p>
<p class="wheatFont">As I experienced the chill I thought that maybe we live only to maintain our shit when the depravity of the ignorant and powerful assault our being.</p>

<p class="violetFont">"<i>And all our infrastructure was built with lower temperatures in mind. Chaos has reigned. There were train tracks on fire, roads and airport runways melting, <b>police smashing car windows to rescue boiling dogs</b>, forest fires, suburban houses all over London burning down, Beefeaters being given bottles of water to suckle from like baby goats, surgeries cancelled because operating theatres were too hot, ambulances being called out left right and center to treat heat exposure, people’s leather sofas and rubbish bins and fences going up in flames.

<p class="violetFont"><img src="./public/pics/matchgirl.png" alt="Match Girl"></p>
<p class="violetFont">Dogchat (In the sidebar) is working).  Feed the dog with <i>feedback</i>.  You have to be a real person now to register because a registration code is emailed to you.  That means not any made up email address will do.  I will work on dogchat more later.  But since it works, and people can register; getting normal for a while might be a good idea.</p>
<p class="violetFont">I will add a way to write comments below articles I write.  Dogchat members will be able to write comments in a decent editor.  Dogchat itself will stay simple.  In Dogchat I will add a way for a user to nuke their own most recent comment.  I will do this for editing reasons.  This lets a user 'redo'.  Crude editing.  Perhaps a pop-up editor later with a time limit.  I have seen that before.  I will do it better.  I have seen editors with four minute fixed countdowns.  The four minute needs to reset as long as a person is actively editing.</p>
<p class="violetFont">On second thought, going straight to a pop-up editor is better.</p>
<p class="violetFont">'<i>A way to write comments below articles I write.</i>' I already have a working model for this.  It has a nice editor and comments link between authors in a clever way.  I wrote it a couple of years ago.  I need to un-can it, and then rewrite it to work for dogchat members.  It is nicer than what anyone else has.  (* update)  The working model used to work but that was a computer crash ago. The code is broken and I must forensically sleuth my own method out in the pile of code which remains.</p>
<p class="violetFont">What I did here today isn't an article, but you may have something to say about it.</p>
<p class="violetFont">So register in Dogchat AND SAY IT.  Don't be a little bitch.  Using Dogchat is easy and safe, so say it.  I will not give your email address out to ANYONE, and I will turn on the user delete function as soon as there is a user or two to delete.  I have it off now because my Johnny Depp and Amber Heard fake identities can be used to check dogchat out with (see the sidebar).  The identities can be deleted with the password shown in the sidebar if I activate the delete code.  I don't want that to happen today.</p>
<p class="violetFont">A guest dog who needs no password but whose dogchat remarks delete after 5 minutes.  Could be interesting?</p>

<p class="oliveFont"><center class="oliveFont"><b>Chat Obsession</b></center></p>
<p class="oliveFont">July 16th, 2022</p>
<p class="oliveFont">Yesterday evening in You-Tube I was chatting at <a target="_blank" class="redFont" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl4CKlGP9KM"><i>the Environmental Coffeehouse</i></a>.  Jeremy Jimenez is the show guest at the Coffeehouse link if you follow it.  In the top chat replay next to the video, you can see Kim Centeno say hi Keith to me.  I had announced that the temperature was 79 in Seattle.  Kim knows I live close and said 'I should know'.</p>
<p class="oliveFont">Half the people at the Environmental Coffeehouse think climate change is going to cook the planet.  The human race will go extinct.  They may be right.  Temperature reports are an obsession at the Coffeehouse.</p>
<p class="oliveFont">I did not know who Jeremy Jimenez was before the show.  I learned Jeremy was recently interviewed by Sam Mitchell as the show started.  Sam Mitchell, a performance artist otherwise known as Hambone.  I noted Jeremy has about the same number of views my own Sam Mitchell interview had before Sam and I had a falling out.  Hambone went Joe Stalin on me and deleted my 4000+ view ass from his You-Tube Channel.  I have a copy.  Someday I will delete it.</p>
<p class="oliveFont">It was a lively chat.  I was in a mood, and I was harsh on Jeremy in the chat.  I don't regret it, and I was not the only one.  Jeremy lives a high carbon lifestyle and made endless excuses about it.  There was a lot of doomer 101 talk I was already familiar with.  I have my hunter-gatherer, indigenous, privileged, white man talk down. Campfire domination.  Start talking about how the plow changed humanity.  A few You-Tube vids will get you up to speed.  Reading also works.  Esoteric knowledge at the touch of a finger.  But knowledge that, at the end of the day, is knowledge that does not lead to, or promote solutions.</p>
<p class="oliveFont">Sandy has it hard.  The owner of the Coffeehouse.  Sandy wants to build community.  Sandy would like people to get along.  I understand, sympathize, and empathize with her.  Sandy's problem is that to be serious about a sane future, past bullshit can't be tolerated.  Concerning the end of the world, many egos spew much bullshit.  Time is wasted.</p>
<p class="oliveFont">To be serious about a sane future in the land that worships D.B. Cooper is an impossible task.</p>
<p class="oliveFont">Veg of <a target="_blank" class="redFont" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/VegematicDeluxe"><i>the Vegematic</i></a> was there but did not type.</p>
<p class="oliveFont">You-Tube chat is one of my things.  I can type fast when I am not typing here.  Here I polish.  You-Tube chat is one of the inspirations for DogChat now in my sidebar.</p>
<p class="oliveFont">Anything resembling an email will let you register, and you can tell me you think I am full of it if you wish.  You will be anonymous.  But hurry if you do because it won't last.  I am working on email verification.  Users will soon be able to do more than chat in DogChat, but they don't know it yet.  I will need email verification in the future.  As part of the Dogchat project, I had to set up an email server for this website.  At the bottom of this page, a new K-Dog email address goes to my own mailserver.  Woof on that!  Google can't watch it.</p>
<p class="oliveFont">Writing here,  I see hits on my globe and know that they are not all bots.  Actually they are, I am not immune to self-deception.  They are all bots.  But in case they are not, and I am wrong, I try and compose a 1000 wordish article each week.  Thirty readers would be enough.  Here I am.</p>
<p class="oliveFont">Yesterday I worked my code to bring dogchat to the next level.  Users must be able to change passwords and delete their accounts if they want.  I will add the ability for users to delete their most recent entry if they wish. Old chats will be deleted.</p>
<p class="oliveFont">But for now, users are anonymous.  Dogchat for the time being is the wild west, but nobody even says hi.</p>
<p class="oliveFont">So it goes.</p>
<p class="oliveFont">I am not close to doing 1000 words a week for now.  Dogchat is where my effort goes.  Dogchat 2.0 by the end of the month?</p>

<p class="wheatFont"><center><span class="wheatFont"><b>Hemmingway of the Donbass</b></span></center></p>
<p class="wheatFont">July 8th, 2022</p>
<p class="wheatFont">"<i>We are not offering the integrity, competence, and vision necessary to unleash the enormous potential of our country.</i>"</p>
<p class="wheatFont">Self-deception is a wonderful thing.  We would all lose our minds without it.  Maybe not all of us would, surely most of us would.  You have a right to be here and have a good life.  Did you know this?  Likely you do not.  You think the right to be here has to be earned in some way.  If you do know, something in you fights the idea.  I did not always know.</p>
<p class="wheatFont">We learn behaving some ways makes us bad people.  It is a tragic lesson.  As children, the sophistications of adults overwhelms.  As adults we teach badly, and in the end spirits are broken.</p>
<p class="wheatFont">"<i>There ain't no rest for the wicked, Money don't grow on trees, I got bills to pay, I got mouths to feed.  There ain't nothing in this world for free.</i>"</p>
<p class="wheatFont">The compliance of broken spirits confused with lessons learned. But self-deception is a wonderful thing.  It feels great.</p>
<p class="wheatFont">Jeremy Hunt made the quote about integrity, competence, and vision.  Jeremy is a British MP.  An aesthete of privilege.  Not on the struggle bus experiencing, 'no rest for the wicked'.  The destiny most of us share.  Jeremy's kind of wicked gets plenty of rest.  His quote was a slap at Boris Johnson, who has to step down from being top dog for being a bad person.  Bad persons reasons are good enough when inflation in the UK is beyond 9%.  If good times are rolling then bad behavior is only amusing.  As with Trump squeezing all the oil out of our rocks here and sending it abroad.</p>
<p class="wheatFont">British inflation is bad.  In May, housing and utilities inflated at 19.4% there.  Transport climbed at 13.8%, with furniture & household goods up at 10.5%.  Things that <b>average Joe's pay for</b>.</p>
<p class="wheatFont">Inflation for the aesthete is less so 'what me worry'.  In May, British restaurant and hotel prices were inflating at 7.6%.  Recreation and culture inflating at a relaxing 5%.  American inflation is almost as bad.  Inflation here is over 8%.  As in the UK, the USA average Joe is buggered the worst.  Most of us who work here drive to work.  The average Joe feels the sudden climb in price.</p>
<p class="wheatFont">Integrity, competence, and vision.  Something Jeremy himself does not have.  Self-deception is a wonderful thing.  To keep from going crazy, we all do it.</p>
<p class="wheatFont">The British have had issues with Russia going way back.  On that Jeremy plays follow the leader.  <a class="redFont" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/138299.The_Great_Game">The Great Game</a> started with Victorian Britain and Tsarist Russia.  Somebody please send me a copy.  I'd like to read it.  America also does a pied-piper thing with Russia.  Hating on Russia goes back to the end of WWII here.</p>
<p class="wheatFont">Starting with the emergence of corporate rule and capitalist domination.</p>
<p class="wheatFont">People play follow the leader.  That is what they do.  And there is "<i>no rest for the wicked until we close our eyes for good</i>".  There are always plenty of wicked to follow.</p>
<p class="wheatFont">Ignorance keeps America and the British Great Game going.  In the forum I now have with RE of the former Doomstead Diner, this week RE posted a video.  The video is six years old, from the Doomstead.  RE did the interviewing.  Surly1 did great video editing.</p>
<p class="wheatFont">I brought the video here.  In the video RE, the owner of the Doomstead Diner interviews <a class="redFont" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://russelltexasbentley.org/wp/">Russell Bentley</a>.  The Donbass Cowboy.  The interest of the Diner was to find out how people were adapting to the 2016 Ukraine situation.  Their situation.  The video is good history about those times.</p>
<p class="wheatFont">Russell in his way is deceived.  Deceived as all the rest of us are in our ways.  Russell,s talk of Nazi's eating babies and raping Southern Ukrainian women in the streets lost me.  But these thoughts work for Russell, and Russel thrives in a cauldron of ethnic tension.  A conflict zone where people die.  For most of us not our cup of tea.</p>
<p class="wheatFont">Make up your own mind about Russell being looney-tunes.  The video is good, very good.  The parallel with the Spanish Civil War is a nice touch.  The background the video gives is news not covered in America.  The average viewer not aware of the Ukraine situation before 2022 - <b>should jolt to new awareness</b>.</p>
<p class="wheatFont">The layers of an Onion are many.</p>

<p class="wheatFont">On my right sidebar, <b>Dogchat is working</b>.  Dogchat remains a work in progress, but now it is a <b>WORKING</b> work in progress.  My fake identities continue to test my app as I tweak things behind the scenes for a while.  At this time talking to myself is not demonstration of mental illness.  The end of all my code tweaking will be to move on and expand user capability.</p>
<p class="wheatFont">There is no need to do this today.  Having the depth of forum chats automatically chopped at 100 lines seems a good way to manage things.</p>
<p class="wheatFont">And with 1 user I am not worried about having to do email verification yet.</p>
<p class="wheatFont">Last night I added code so screens auto update.  A technical detail for those interested.  Different screens update at different rates.</p>
<p class="wheatFont">I <a class="redFont" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://scheerpost.com/2022/07/03/ron-kovic-the-dark-irony-of-this-patriotic-orgy-and-the-celebration-of-war/">lament</a> America has no anti-war movement.</p>
<p class="oliveFont"><center><span class="oliveFont"><b>Late But Here</b></span></center></p>
<p class="oliveFont">July 3rd, 2022</p>
<p class="oliveFont">Time to write something.  Consistency in writing something here is a goal for me until I decide it is not. So what happened to writing on Friday?  Between my job and code for Dogchat. (press the 'Enter Chat' button under the visitors globe)  I have not written, no time for all the stuff.</p>
<p class="oliveFont">Previous scribblings told readers how to check out  Dogchat progress.  Using fake account emails and passwords.  You can  make up your own fake account.  The hard part is finding a picture to upload.</p>
<p class="oliveFont">Nobody made an account so far.  Nobody has left a message using one of the test identities.  There is nothing to see without pressing the button, and there is no reason for me to worry about trolls today.</p>
<p class="oliveFont">Person to person messaging is essentially complete.   Colors need tweeking and the app remains basic.  I will keep things  simple.  Users will be able to delete accounts and such before I seriously launch.  I will have  password verification emails and I will remove test accounts when I get real.</p>
<p class="oliveFont">The next thing to do here is make my forum page.  So far, Dogchat uses about a thousand lines of code.  It has taken a lot of polish to make the app shine as bright as it does.  (As you will see if you press the button and make up a fake email.) When the forum page works and you see it below the globe, all users will have a picture.  That is why users must have one to do anything.</p>
<p class="oliveFont">Life outside the circle I spin in does not seem to be going well.  America swims in a plethora of propaganda.  Different kinds of propaganda.  Many Kinds.  This year amped-up the decade old Maidan circus of deceptions and laptop secrets.  For years, Ukraine bullshit was a specialty issue outside mainstream awareness.  Putin changed things up.  Thinking brains realize America would do the same thing if Russia staged missiles in Toronto suburbs or the fine City of London Ontario.  I digress.</p>
<p class="oliveFont">America would invade Canada and wheat exports would suffer.  Any Questions?</p>
<p class="oliveFont">Russia is going to win.  People with brains understand this.  So why is there pain, suffering, and pointless death?  That is what sending weapons to Ukraine does.</p>
<p class="oliveFont"><a class="redFont" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://files.libcom.org/files/ursula-k-le-guin-the-ones-who-walk-away-from-omelas.pdf">The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas</a> by Ursula K. Le Guin haunts me with the answer.  By taking from others, capitalism gives great wealth to some.  The American religion, it is prosperity at a price.  The ones who walk away in Ursula's story never go back to Omelas.  Nobody knows where they go.  Did tigers eat them?  No.  The story does not say yeas or no, but I understand that decades of people walking away with zero going back means they had a better place to go.</p>
<p class="oliveFont">Omelas is America.  Spell it backwards, and Omelas is Salem Oregon.</p>
<p class="oliveFont">Their happiness, the beauty of their cities, the joy of friends.  Their health, and the wisdom of those who choose to be wise.  The magic of American tools.  The national bounty of grain, meat, and high fructose corn syrup.  Central heating.  It all depends on black liquid and underground gas coming from the ground.</p>
<p class="oliveFont">The child locked away is the child of future generations that will never be.  Future generations will have no oil below them.  Salem Oregon, Omelas by another name.  It will all be gone.</p>
<p class="oliveFont">Weapon sales, like slavery, Indian killing and imperialism are evil.  America sells weapons with the aim of killing random Russian people.  Selling weapons to strangers is evil.  Thinking brains know this.  But the festival of summer.  Beer and drooze. Nacirema delights with pleasures of all kinds.  The Kardashians.  Chinese fireworks.  It all distracts from the brutal truths of Omelas. The doom we face, and the end of suffering that results.  A doom that seven dollars a gallon gas only hints at.</p>

<p class="pinkFont">amber@crazybitch.nuts and johnny@missingfinger.hurts with passwords 'fuckjohnny' and 'fuckamber' will log you onto K-Dog Chat in the right sidebar.  Doing so will show you a searchable list of users.  Clicking on a user in the list will let you chat with your selection.  If you log in as Amber, click on Johnny's picture or name.  If you log in as Johnny click on Amber's picture.  Both ways show a conversation that looks like a text message on your phone.</p>
<p class="pinkFont">K-Dog Chat is not practical.  Not yet.  To update  the display in a real conversation you go back to the user list  with the arrow.  Then re-select who your are chatting with.  So far my chat  only functional at a basic level.  My app is a work in progress.  Today  is the first day that chat is working at all.</p>
<p class="pinkFont">Person to person chat.  The mode that started working today is not my goal.  I want people to be able to write inside a message box that everyone sees on my page.  A forum.  If I wrote the forum box first I would have added messaging between users later.  I am writing my code the other way around.</p>
<p class="pinkFont">For now anybody can make up a fake address and  upload a picture to create a user.  There are no user approval emails.   User approval with emails and codes I'll add when K-Dog Chat is  ready for serious use.  Messages and users put in now are for test.   Messages and users will be deleted later.  Emails have to follow basic rules with an  '@' and a 'dot' character.</p>
<p class="pinkFont">Writing my own chat code is an all-consuming task.  Writing code gives no time to read or write articles.  I obsess until I have something working.  Getting K-Dog Chat functional is a milestone, and it is time for a break now.  Much remains to be done on my project, but I will slow down for a while.</p>
<p><center><span class="beigeFont"><b>Coming Attractions</b></span></center></p>
<p class="beigeFont">June 17th, 2022</p>
<p class="beigeFont">On the right sidebar, you now see K-Dog Chat.  My chat will resemble chat next to a YouTube livestream or text messages on your cell phone.</p>
<p class="beigeFont">Porting my working prototype over to this website is difficult.  My prototype does not use dynamic HTML, but as dogchat will live in the sidebar, I need to implement dynamic HTML.  Without dynamic HTML, the page reloads all the time.  If dynamic HTML makes no sense to you, don't worry about it.  Dynamic HTML lets a program write new content to a webpage.</p>
<p class="beigeFont">All you can do now is toggle between a login dialog, and a signup dialog on the right sidebar.  Toggle between them using the red links under the 'Continue to Chat' button on the dialog.  You have to click the join button to see the login form.</p><p class="beigeFont">To get a hint of what's up, you can log in using email: amber@crazybitch.nuts, password: fuckjohnny.  The email: johnny@missingfinger.hurts using password: fuckamber also works.  All users will have an image like Johnny and Amber do.</p>
<p class="beigeFont"><center class="beigeFont"><video poster="./public/pics/Tim Watkins _The Great Simplification.png" controls="" width="600"><source src="./public/videos/Tim Watkins _The Great Simplification.mp4" type="video/mp4">No embedded video support</video></center></p>
<p class="beigeFont"><center class="beigeFont">Tim Watkins of the Consciousness of Sheep talks to Nate Hagens.</center></p>
<p class="beigeFont">Tim Watkins is a British K-Dog.  Like Nate and I, Tim knows the greatest threat to human survival is human nature.</p>
<p class="beigeFont">Climate destruction and resource depletion can't be addressed.  Human brains do not deal with existential threat.  Climate destruction is the new kid on the block, but climate destruction is not the first existential threat America ignores.  Nate, Tim and I know climate destruction is a serious a problem.  But bad as it is, climate destruction will not be what makes Americans extinct.  Climate can do that by itself, but running out of diesel fuel will kill America first.</p>
<p class="beigeFont">Diesel engines drive America.  Diesel engines haul everything which satisfy American needs.  All needs, essential, basic or trivial.  Whatever the need, diesel trucks are part of satisfying the need.</p>
<p class="beigeFont">Food can't be grown without heavy use of diesel powered farm machinery.  Shelter can't be built without diesel trucks hauling construction materials.  Clothing made in factories across oceans moved by diesel powered ships is delivered by diesel powered trucks.</p>
<p class="beigeFont">Diesel fuel costs more than six dollars a gallon in America now.  The cost of diesel rises to a witching price.  But this is simple math, nothing supernatural about the witching price.
<p class="beigeFont">The average American earns about 25 dollars an hour.  Diesel supply not keeping up with demand makes diesel fuel cost more.  As diesel fuel prices rises beyond seven dollars a gallon, then $25 an hour can't provide the basics of food shelter and clothing.  Prices for everything rise beyond the ability of most to pay.  When this happens, basic needs can't and won't be met.  The world as we know will quickly end.</p>
<p class="beigeFont">American store shelves are looking like store shelves in the old Soviet Union.  Empty.  Supply chain problems blamed for barren shelves.  In America, goods to feed the diesel driven supply chain are assumed to come from bottomless horns of plenty.  America thinks something to do with Covid-19 and Ukraine cause current price woes.  But materials to manufacture everything are delivered by diesel trucks.  Without diesel engines there is no horn of plenty to give America the magic that makes modern life possible.  Nothing can be put into the horn or taken out of it without diesel fuel.  And diesel is in short supply.</p>
<p class="beigeFont">OPEC has not been able to reach oil production targets for five months in a row.  Inadequate production causes a shortage of diesel fuel and the problem will only get worse.</p>
<p class="beigeFont">Population grew.  Demand for diesel rose beyond what can be produced.  Covid-19 and Ukraine accelerated the inevitable,  but they are not the cause.  Population growth meeting peak oil is the cause.</p>
<p class="beigeFont">Nate Hagen and Tim Watkins talk of community and the need to build it.  I agree.  Community and a return to community values is the only thing that can challenge existing arrangements.  Worship of the individual and ignorance of the Earths physical limits got us into this mess.  Ignorance of limits becomes harder to maintain, but the religion of the individual is even harder to give up.  Humans are stubborn.</p>
<p class="beigeFont">Everybody lives in ticky-tacky boxes with immediate family now.  Knowing neighbors is not what Americans do.  Relationships with neighbors interfere with Americas' Machiavellian chase for the dollar.  A chase which quickens in our witching hour.</p>
<p class="beigeFont">American politicians are not about community.  American politicians police capitalism.  American politicians exist to maintain existing arrangements.  Need for change in the mind of an American politician is as rare as snow in Florida.  Politicians talk of change, but that is all they do, talk.  Actual change would upset the carefully cultivated divide between American rich and poor.  Politicians are all about making the American grand canyon of inequality wider.  As Nate and Tim say.  America does not have a technology or energy problem.  Americans have a cultural problem.</p>
<p class="beigeFont">I agree with Tim and Nate about that.  Technical and energy problems ignored can't be solved.  American culture ignores and resists anything and everything suggesting changing existing social arrangements.  America is stuck, and in a very bad place.</p>
<p class="beigeFont">What Nate and Tim don't say is growing 'community' means adopting a modern socialism.  Rugged individualism and capitalism, the American religions, do not work in a world of limits.  Community is about give and take, cooperation.  In America, suggesting community as an answer is stupid and nerdy.  Saying socialism is an answer, blasphemy.  I understand the desire to avoid the 'S' word.</p>
<p class="beigeFont">I listen to fellow thinkers of doom, and few are able to put aside unrealistic optimism.  The need to re-weave social fabric is a depressing thought best avoided.  Re-weaving social fabric is a depressing thought, the job seems impossible. America is not feeling any spirit of revolution.  We all have our head in the sand.  Talk of quick fixes preferred. We pray to technology gods.</p>
<p class="beigeFont">Modernity lives in a digital world.  The memory of the printed word now lost.  The digital world is without memory or past.  If Google does not want you to see or know about something, their search links disappear.  Memory fades away.</p>
<p class="beigeFont">In the old world of libraries, books, and magazines, erasing and restricting information was harder to do than now.  American mainstream propaganda and censorship grew to levels comparable to World War I over the last year.  Dummied down America is unable to comprehend our current predicament.  America is in a very bad place.</p>

<p class="beigeFont">Almost six dollars a gallon for gas on my way home from unloading a diesel truck today.  I will be writing about Nate's new video soon.  The cover image for Nate's video comes from a graph shown in the video.  When I write about this I will make an observation about a trend that began in 2011 on this graph.</p>

You could post a user, but make  sure the file picker is set to show all files if you do or you may not see your  image. Users must have an image.  Make up an email.  It is all for test.  When I launch I will delete test users.  Searching for users is possible.  Online status shows.  All the app could do before today is show the logged in user.  Online status will be stuck on as people forget to log off.  Something to fix.<br></p>

<p class="beigeFont"><center class="beigeFont">Jimmy Corsetti has a channel named 'Bright Insight'</center></p></p>
<p class="beigeFont">The end is nigh it seems.</p>
<p class="beigeFont">Now I am writing about two videos.  Nate's video is Peak Oil 101.  It reminds me of the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="text-decoration: none;" class="redFont" href="https://www.postcarbon.org/">Post Carbon Institute</a>.  This is not a criticism.  I respect the Post Carbon Institute.  Most Americans are ignorant of post carbon facts and I mean no criticism by this.  Some of you are young and don't know better.  This is esoteric repressed knowledge, suppressed by active propaganda campaigns.  Please visit the link.  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="text-decoration: none;" class="redFont" href="https://www.postcarbon.org/the-energy-food-crisis-is-far-worse-than-most-americans-realize/">The Energy / Food Crisis Is Far Worse than Most Americans Realize</a>, is one of many great articles at the institute.</p>
<p class="beigeFont">Jimmy Corsetti may not get that the oil can't be had because it is not under our feet anymore.  Nate's video has a cover picture showing by color the amount of oil counties produce each year. In September of 2011 the United States produced a minor share of the worlds oil.  The blue hump on top of the graph is American fracked oil.  The United States is now the worlds leading producer of oil.</p>
<p class="beigeFont">America's oil is coming from cracked rock.  This can't go on forever and when it can't America will starve and society will collapse.  Jimmy Corsetti and Nate Hagens likely don't know each other.  They are two good men with different perspectives on the same, very real, problem.</p>
<p class="beigeFont">The blue bump on the top of Nate's production graph started on the Obama POTHUS watch.  Republicans continued his rape of  America.  Oil trains grew long in the Trump administration.  All this has been to support an elite of rich.  To create obscene profits for the blessed.</p>
<p class="beigeFont">Fracked oil is not extracted to benefit America.  Money from fracked oil keeps existing social arrangements intact.  To build bank accounts of a privileged few.  The unfair arrangement needs deception so a fiction of invincibility shrouds America.  America imagines life in a party that can't end.  It is a religion.</p>
<p class="beigeFont">Ignorance of energy issues is a carefully cultivated crop fertilized by propaganda.  America has the best energy ignorance money buys.  Growth propaganda is endless.  Now the American people must pay back borrowed time of investors who made fracked oil money.  For average people there will be great suffering.</p>

<p class="monarchFont">June 10th, 2022</p>
<p class="monarchFont">Coming soon, something new.</p>
<p class="monarchFont">You may have wondered what the logon button is on the top of my right sidebar.  It is a way to leave comments on my articles.  But nobody wanted to do comments here.  Nobody interested, I stopped putting code needed for comments below my articles.  Making having an account  useless.</p>
<p class="monarchFont">Nobody interested, or it was too hard to use?  I am not sure  which.  Less than a dozen people ever registered.</p>
<p class="monarchFont">Last week illness made writing my article late.  This weeks' work schedule does the same.  I will have new writing up sometime this week.</p>
<p class="monarchFont">I could have written to my anti-war theme yesterday. But in a nation that went brain dead with first-person shooter games thirty years ago, what is the point of that?</p>
<p class="monarchFont">I had time for writing an article yesterday.  Instead I worked on software to replace the login button on the top of my sidebar.  You still see the login button now because I am not finished with my changes.</p>
<p class="monarchFont">It will be a few weeks before you see anything new.  It is more than one article worth of mental effort so it will take a while.  I am pleased with yesterdays' progress.  It looks good.  But I won't upload my new code before I finish it.  Or tell you what I am doing.</p>
<p class="monarchFont">Writing last weeks' article over a few days worked out well for me so I will do something like that this week.</p>
<p><center><span class="pinkFont"><b>Famine</b></span></center></p>
<p class="pinkFont">June 6th, 2022</p>
<p class="pinkFont">I recovered from my cold.  I shall write something this week after all.</p>
<p class="pinkFont">Dr. John, for Mrs. Dog and I, was our go-to-guy for Covid-19 info.  Dr. John's info got us through the pandemic.  If you do not know who he is, Dr. John is well known in the UK.  He is a popular and respected health care educator. Dr. John gives solid science based advice.  He is all about the truth.</p>
<p class="pinkFont">It was natural for Dr. John to appear in my YouTube suggestions.  I used to watch Dr. John every day.  Perhaps he appeared in your YouTube suggestions, perhaps not.  Regardless, Dr. John's message is worth amplification.  Covid-19 is no longer the biggest health threat to the world.  Famine is now our big concern.</p>
<p class="pinkFont">Dr. John cites a book he used illustrations from.  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="text-decoration: none;" class="redFont" href="https://chasingthesquirrel.com/public/share/Where%20There%20Is%20No%20Doctor.pdf">Here it is.</a>  People of the Doom-O-Sphere.  Otherwise known as those who know the world as we know it will soon end, will consider the book valuable.  It is a village health care handbook.</p>
<p class="pinkFont">Dr. John uses two references from the United Nations in his report. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="text-decoration: none;" class="redFont" href="https://www.fao.org/worldfoodsituation/en/">The World Food Situation.</a>  This report is authored by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.  Dr. John's second reference is a UN press release.  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="text-decoration: none;" class="redFont" href="https://www.un.org/press/en/2022/sc14894.doc.htm">Lack of Grain Exports Driving Global Hunger to Famine Levels, as War in Ukraine Continues, Speakers Warn Security Council.</a>  Dr. John deals in facts.</p>

<p class="pinkFont"><center class="pinkFont">Dr. John talks famine here, and I report on his video below.</center></p>  
<p class="pinkFont">Human population growth reached planetary boundaries.  That is the real problem.  Too many people to feed.  Without fossil fueled farming technology, the world would be starving already.</p>
<p class="pinkFont">Only fossil fuels give a harvest big enough to feed 8 billion people.  Eight billion people depend on fertilizer.  And most of the worlds' fertilizer comes from Russia.  Made from Russian natural gas.  Last year, climate change reduced crop yields around the world, and this year is no different.  Climate change weather is now obvious.  The war in Ukraine exacerbates climate change issues.  Accelerating the inevitable collapse of the modern world.</p>
<p class="pinkFont">Ukraine produced food to feed 400 million people before the Russian war began.  Together, Russia and Ukraine produce 30% of the worlds' wheat.  In early February, Ukraine was shipping 4.5 million metric tonnes of grain a month.  20 million metric tonnes of grain from last years' harvest wait in Ukraine silos to be shipped.  Only ships from Black Sea ports can move this grain.  Moving this much grain by truck would need two million trucks.  Roads that don't exist would also be needed.  Black Sea ports move a lot of food.  Two examples are corn and sunflower oil.  Fifteen percent of the worlds' corn, and 67% of the worlds' sunflower oil, pass through Black Sea ports.</p>
<p class="pinkFont">Acute food security is severe malnutrition. From 2018 to 2021 the number of people in acute food insecurity across the globe increased by 88%.  The number is now 139 million, with 161 million acutely food insecure projected for this year.  The Russian war will only make things worse.  People in East Africa and the Middle East will be the ones to suffer first.</p>
<p class="pinkFont">Dr. John had the Chicago spot wheat price obviously wrong, so I looked it up.  Dr. John is good about correcting his mistakes in his later videos.  As things are, Chicago wheat futures remain above $10 per bushel.  Nearly 25% above the price before the war began. One year ago, wheat was selling for nearly $6 per bushel according to the Chicago Board of Trade. The increase in price since then is substantial.  Overall, food prices are up 30% since the start of the war.</p>
<p class="pinkFont">The world is on the cusp of a crisis that will not end, yet nobody seems to care.  In America, divorces of millionaires are more important than the future of humanity.  This is what the love of money has done.  Republicans want to solve America's problem of mass shootings with more guns.  Arm teachers while they make capital gains money from arm shipments to Ukraine.  Arm shipments that could usher in a nuclear war.  And all so Hunter can buy a new laptop.</p>
<p class="pinkFont">People in conflict zones will suffer  the most.  That is what happens in war.  People in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="text-decoration: none;" class="redFont" href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/1-1-million-afghan-children-under-5-could-face-severe-malnutrition-this-year-u-n-says">Afghanistan</a>, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Haiti, Nigeria, Pakistan, South Sudan, Syria, and Yemen are where most of the 139 million food insecure are.  These are all conflict zones.  Places Americans ignore.  But with gasoline and all other fossil fuel products up in price everywhere along with food, poor people across the globe will suffer.</p>

<p class="pinkFont">* A deeper dive, this new video gives good detail of how the Ukraine  situation is affecting the rest of the world.  Put great pressure on anyone who can bring the Ukraine conflict to an equatable  peaceful end.  Zelensky must wrap his head around options for peace which he has dismissed so far. Stubbornness on both sides will only prolong  misery around the world.</p>

<p><center><span class="wheatFont"><b>Same Old Shit</b></span></center></p>
<p class="wheatFont">June 3rd, 2022</p>
<p class="wheatFont">Different week, same problems.  No interest in solutions anywhere across brain-dead America.  That is what I was going to write about, but I have a bad cold that is keeping me in bed today.  My fever is 100 degrees.  I am taking the week off.  Today life sucks.</p>
<p><center><span class="oliveFont"><b>National Derangement</b></span></center></p>
<p class="oliveFont">May 27th, 2022</p>
<p class="oliveFont">Yesterday I did my wage slave thing.  Two weeks ago eighteen-year-old Salvador Ramos was doing his wage slave thing, but he quit.  With no paycheck on payday to pick up, and not able to graduate high school on May 23rd with his peers, Salvador Ramos ruined his life in an emotional meltdown of murderous mayhem on May 24th.</p>
<p class="oliveFont">Salvador Ramos decided to become America's next mass shooter. Salvador Ramos has 'five-teen' minutes of infamy now. He will be infamous perhaps a week before America's next mass shooter steals his thunder. And Salvador can't enjoy his flash of infamy, he's dead. Salvador became a corpse while becoming infamous.</p>
<p class="oliveFont">Salvador Ramos is a flash in the pan, but America's melting pot boils with disturbed people.  Every day like a pot on a stove, disturbed souls boil over to splash the rest of us with their scalding derangement.  To keep from being scalded, America should stop making disturbed people. This is an obvious and sane solution, and it will be ignored.</p>
<p class="oliveFont">Aeons ago, when I was 18, graduating high school was mandatory.  Becoming a dropout was never an option.  The dropout rate in my high school was less than 3%.  Academic standards were high.  Police would investigate kids who looked like they skipped school.  People went to church and everyone was part of a family.  You could be Jewish or Islamic or whatever where I lived, and most citizens were colorblind.  Being tolerant was a virtue.  People helped each other.  The infection of racism was not as strong as it was in the rest of America.  Racism was weak in my northern big city.  Weak enough so most people were embarrassed to show the disease if they had it.  People behaved themselves.</p>
<p class="oliveFont">Cold weather makes good citizens.  Half the year is fatal in the Northern Midwest.  If you don't have shelter and good clothing, you freeze.  Nobody needed AAA if there was car trouble.  Helping others was normal.</p>
<p class="oliveFont">Life had structure.  Hard work paid off.  The future was bright and only getting better.  With fifty K a year, you would live like a king.  Most dads raised their kids on twenty just fine.</p>
<p class="oliveFont">My dad was a hard-ass.  I was 12 years old when he told me the only money I was going to get was money I earned.  I was not going to get any from him.  My dad is gone now.  At the end, he regretted that he kept his word to me.  I told him it was OK.  Things worked out well enough for me.  Earning my life gives me a good feeling.</p>
<p class="oliveFont">Fifty cents an hour for lawn mowing did not go very far.  Paper Routes did better, but were dangerous.  Delivering newspapers on an inch of new ice in a blizzard risks a fall. Dogs were a constant danger.  I love dogs, but in a square mile of suburban newspaper delivery area there was always at least one bad dog.</p>
<p class="oliveFont">Legal working age was 16, but I was a freshwater tropical fish expert at 14.  The local pet shop hired me to clean animal cages and talk fish.  One dollar an hour under the table.  I was in heaven.  A few hours after school and a full day, sometimes two on weekends.  When I was 16 and legal, I had been raised to $2.75 an hour.</p>
<p class="oliveFont">As the years went by, I had a lot of different jobs.  University took forever.  I supported a family.  It took a few years to settle down and become a proper student.  I become one and I earned professional degrees.  My passion for tropical fish was replaced by a passion to understand electronics.  I became an engineer.  Becoming good at what I do is important.</p>
<p class="oliveFont">Before writing any of this, I read for an hour everything I could about Salvador Ramos.  Salvador was cruel.  His relatives claim he was bullied.  But guys who shoot other people with BB guns for shits and grins are at least one step beyond asshole.  They are bullies.  Salvador's brain wrinkles may not have been right.  In a land of 300 million+, shit happens.  Bad brain folding happens somewhere.  But I can't help wonder if things could have been different for Salvador Ramos.</p>
<p class="oliveFont">There was too much structure in my life for me to have ever been a school shooter.  My dreams never went beyond blowing up empty school buildings, and that as only something fun to think about.  Certainly not seriously.  I was into science and read books.  I liked school.  I have good brain wrinkles.  Before the Internet, I went to the library.  Now I work part-time.</p>
<p class="oliveFont">I have my own dark side but I learned to harness my feelings before I did myself in.</p>
<p class="oliveFont">We start out more the same than we become.  Life leads us in different directions.  I had the advantage of structure long enough to learn to shape myself.  I become what I do.  I become how I act.  I become what I think.  I am fortunate.</p>
<p class="oliveFont">Some things, some doings, are better than other doings and other things.  There are some futures worth being a part of, some futures not worth having.</p>
<p class="oliveFont">But America lost structure.  People overloaded with choice and buried under an avalanche of change are dizzy with confusion.  We live in a time where anything goes and nothing matters, leaving even the most capable confused.  Everything became the same in the confusion, and now nothing is allowed to be better than anything else.</p>
<p class="oliveFont">The Buffalo shooter Payton Gendron also 18, was the shooter of the month before Ramos stole his thunder.  Payton is a tape recorder of crack-pot hate.  Nothing in Payton's manifesto is worth reading.  Payton's brain is an emotional sewer.  I have not seen his manifesto, but I read enough description of the Mein Kampfian wannabe tome to know there is nothing original or anything of possible merit in any of it. Payton Gendron is a deranged hate robot.  Bad brain wrinkles perhaps.</p>
<p class="oliveFont">When adults don't know right from wrong, children can't tell the difference.  We all mimic more than we live authentically.  Currently there is a war in Ukraine to mimic.  Cage fighting is a thing.</p>
<p class="oliveFont">Set your own limits is fine advice for anyone able to do so.  But many people only copy others, it is all they can do.  People who copy need direction or they get lost.  Without direction, a path leading to self-destruction of futures, theirs and others, becomes likely.  America has no good direction to offer America's children or anyone else now.  With no good path to follow, we all sink to low levels.  Salvador Ramos needed more direction than his fry burger job could give him.  Bad brain wrinkles or not, people appear to have let the young man down.</p>
<p class="oliveFont">Salvador Ramos and Payton Gendron may be organically defective.  Wanting to kill people, is a defect for sure.  But are their defects from the environment they grew in, or from personal structural defects.  Bad folds of the brain?  Or not?</p>
<p class="oliveFont">The violent Halo video game franchise has sold more than fifty million copies so far.  America celebrates violence.  People enjoy the thrill of violence.  But a small number of people can't understand the difference between entertaining fantasy and real life.  These people mimic.  They can't understand real life is a banquet of consequences.  Concentrating only on their doings, these people can't understand that real doings have any real consequences.  In fantasy consequences don't exist.  Everything works out.  In fantasy that which is the most fun gets done and endings can always change.</p>
<p class="oliveFont">America worships at the church of the Second Amendment.  Guns are fun and there will be another mass shooting soon.  In America, guns are good.  America would rather see schools become fortresses armed by guards looking like prisons than change gun laws.</p>
<p class="oliveFont">I offer no solutions.  Nobody is interested in solutions.  The band plays on.  Fortress schools would teach kids a lesson.  But not a good one.  I keep my solutions to myself.</p>
<p><center><span class="beigeFont"><b>Wheat News</b></span></center></p>
<p class="beigeFont">May 20th, 2022</p>
<p class="beigeFont">One metric ton of wheat is the same as 36.7437 bushels of wheat.  The ratio changes for different grains, so I conclude bushels measure volume.  The anticipated 2022 crop of winter wheat for the United States is 1.173 billion bushels.  This is 39.3 million metric tons and 8% less than the 2021 US winter wheat harvest.  Wheat comes in two varieties, winter and spring.  The difference between winter wheat and spring wheat is when the wheat is planted.  Eighty percent of wheat grown in the Northern Hemisphere is winter wheat.</p>
<p class="beigeFont">How soon the world runs out of wheat is a complicated question and there is no easy answer.  For most of us, the question becomes more simple.  When will YOU run out of the ability to buy products made from wheat becomes the question.  When your ability to buy bread vanishes, your world has run out of wheat.</p>
<p class="beigeFont">A concept to know is carryout.  When a new years' wheat harvest begins, some of last years' harvest remains.  The amount of last years' crop, the ending stock, divided by average daily use gives carryout.  Current carryout is at 104 days.  2021/2022 wheat lasts for 104 days before the 2022/2023 crop will be  used.  A typical carryout value is 122 days.  This year, wheat stocks were down before smoldering Ukraine troubles burst into flame.  Russia hurls western countries to a level of recession not seen since the 1970s.  Carryout next year will be less than 2013/2014.  Then carryout was 88 days.</p>
<p class="beigeFont">Less carryout means more expensive wheat.  The ability to buy wheat will vanish for many before wheat stock hits zero.  People will starve.</p>
<p class="beigeFont">Average Americans do not think about Ukraine or their ability to buy wheat. Modern life does not concern itself with wheat or bread.  Bread is taken for granted.  As if wheat comes from the bottom of a long black endless tube.  For free.  For many, the discovery the universe does not guarantee endless supplies of wheat may be a shock.  I wish I were joking.  I am not.</p>
<p class="beigeFont">Rich people will not lose their ability to buy bread because of Ukraine troubles.  Not this round.  Rich people are making money from the Ukraine debacle.  Russia has spent about 4 billion dollars on the Ukraine invasion so far.  NATO has spent fifty billion dollars.  By this metric, NATO arms dealers are winning the Ukraine profits war hands down.</p>
<p class="beigeFont">Ukraine is about money laundering.  Money is printed, then given to corporations for devices sent to Ukraine to kill people.  The American Senate ordered $40 billion in military and humanitarian aid yesterday.  Print forty billion to supply Kiev with killing devices. Humanitarian aid a lie.  Ukraine is a military-industrial complex bonanza.  A windfall for American corporations everywhere.</p>
<p class="beigeFont">I paid $5.49 for gasoline yesterday.  I doubt gas costs more than the buck fifty and change it has gone up in price over the last few months to produce.  Everything is costing more.  Wages are stagnant.  Capitalism has a banquet.  Corporate profit margins are the largest they've been in 70 years.</p>
<p class="beigeFont">Across the board, American prices are up 7.5% from last year.  Housing is up 4%, the cost of meat is up 12% and a used car costs 40% more.  Corporations are reaping record profits, with inflation at levels not seen in decades.</p>

<p class="beigeFont"><center class="beigeFont">Why Food Prices Are Rising - Economic Update with Richard Wolff</center></p>
<p class="beigeFont">Out and about yesterday, I saw my first military convoy in years.  Infantry fighting vehicles, about twenty.  Some with antitank missile launchers.  A convoy on the move.</p>
<p class="beigeFont">If the vehicles are for export, each one leaving the country spawns millions in replacement contracts.  But I do not know.  The convoy might be for patriotic reasons.  Show the troops.  Support the Senate $40 billion money drop.</p>
<p class="beigeFont">As part of the military aid, send the Biden Laptop to Ukraine.  Wipe the hard drive first.  Forty billion can kill a lot of people.  Why not get rid of a pesky laptop too.</p>
<p class="beigeFont">There is no talk of peace.  The dogs of war howl.  I read in American news, talk of “""NATO expansion""" threatening Russia’s sovereignty is only smoke.  This is the opinion of American news.  Russia has a different opinion.</p>
<p class="beigeFont">Today I read """Zelensky says Donbas 'destroyed' and is now 'hell.'""" This scares me. I know enough to know the political  sympathies of the Donbas.  If it is a hell, then it is Zelensky's doing.</p>
<p class="beigeFont">The Donbas is Russian breakaway territory.  Russia supports and aids the Donbas region.  Zelensky makes no sense and is desperate.  Russia must be doing better in the war than Americans believe.  That's what the Zelensky video tells me.  Now backed by American arms and money, I fear the war grows.</p>
<p class="beigeFont">Cold War II is happening.  The arms industry has convinced Sweden and Finland to join NATO.  This will divide the world as perversely and destructively as the first Cold War did.  This does nothing to end the Ukraine conflict.  Sanctions and NATO expansion strengthen Russian resolve.</p>
<p class="beigeFont">Cold wars cultivate ignorance.  Cold War I narrowed American consciousness incapable of managing any kind of  complexity. It was Cowboy and Indians for adults.  Good guys and bad guys.  Now Russia the bad guys return.  Cornpone simplification is all America gets.</p>
<p class="beigeFont">Cornpone simplification is not a good state of mind to be in.  Climate is changing and energy to keep the wheels of modern civilization turning runs out.  Wisdom of the ages forgotten.  Minds bewitched with digital spectacle are lost in dreams.</p>
<p class="beigeFont">Preparations for the future are not made.  The last thing the world needs is more conflict and war.</p>

<p class="pinkFont">Superstitious people don't like Friday the thirteenth.  They think something bad could happen.  I don't share their superstition.  Thinking a man-made calendar could affect fate is a mental illness.  A fact I never point out to superstitious people.  What is the point of that?  I don't see a reason to give myself unnecessary problems.</p>
<p class="pinkFont">So was I unlucky when I could not upload a new <span class="beigeFont"><b>text color</b></span> today?  As you see in the last sentence before this, I succeeded, but it took a half hour to upload a new 5K file with my new color.  I kept connecting to the server that hosts my files to create this page and p-h-f-f-f-t-t-t-t, I kept getting bumped off.  And after all that, my beige font does not look good next to last weeks' <span class="wheatFont"><b>wheat font</b></span>.  I will wait for next week to use it.  <span class="oliveFont"><b>Olive font</b></span> to separate beige and wheat would have worked too.</p>
<p class="pinkFont">Being bumped off a server for half an hour can happen.  Technical reasons.  But <a class="redFont" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://www.adamsmith.org/blog/galileo-was-forced-to-recant"><b>like Galileo</b></a> I was shown instruments of torture.  The most recent showing was last year.  Code showing a Conor McGregor video appeared and shadowed my own code.  Code showing my <b>Earth Riot Radio</b> player in my right sidebar was not seen.  Earth Riot Radio was in my file where it should be, but my content was not loaded with my page.  Replacement content loaded in its place.  My original code in my file was unchanged.  Code substitution took place at the server when my page loaded.  The night before this, I was talking to my son about Conor McGregor.</p>

<p class="pinkFont"><center class="pinkFont">Connor McGregor on a Stoic Mindset</center></p>
<p class="pinkFont">Coincidence?  No.  I am aware my phone surveils me.  It is what the American Inquisition does.  They make lots of lists, and this sort of thing has happened to me before.  Activity kept hidden unless there is a reason for it not to be.  Intimidation is a reason.  For most reasons and for higher profile people, silence is the policy.</p>
<p class="pinkFont">Without convincing proof, an inconsequential citizen like myself would be mad to think they are important enough to attract five-eye scrutiny.  Before algorithms started surveiling, that might have been true.  Now one algorithm can watch  millions.  But I experience personal attention.  Attention not only from giving George Bush the finger when his motorcade passed by me.  (<i>George's motorcycle escort totally freaked out.</i>)</p>
<p class="pinkFont">Flipping the bird to an American President might have been enough to attract some grief, but I became aware of a Psy-Op discovered by following a hidden link on a website years ago.  A situation that a NDA keeps people quiet about.  But I am not subject to a Non Disclosure Agreement.  My peak down the Homeland Security rabbit hole used a tool in the public domain.  The Psy-Op is ongoing, enough said about that.</p>
<p class="pinkFont">My discovery caused me to create this website.  I am as independent as I can be.  I am not on anybodies' platform for a reason.  I control everything here.  Both content and presentation.  Except for times when I am being fucked with.  But when fuckification happens, who does it can't hide behind someone else.  The fuckification is transparent.  That is what my independence gives me.  I may not know the three letters of the alphabet soup.  But alphabet soup I know it is.</p>
<p class="pinkFont">So what is the situation now?  It is simple.  The American Empire wants to bury Russia so the American 1% can rule the world.  Nice people have trouble understanding this.  To our peril.</p>
<p class="pinkFont"> Joe Biden is requesting $813 billion for next years' military budget. $773 billion for the Pentagon and $40 billion for defense programs at the FBI and other agencies. Forty billion to put Conor McGregor videos in my sidebar if my behavior needs shaping again.  That is how it goes, and that is how the U.S. rolls.  It is a well-kept secret.  Operational security makes sure of that.</p>
<p class="pinkFont">Was it only a technical problem today?  Perhaps it was.  But the American Government is preparing for military  action.  Dissent is squelched.</p>

<p class="pinkFont">I am aware of missing voices.  But that is a hard thing to show.  Proving a negative.  Here Lee Camp and Rachel Blevins discuss censorship.  Having experienced it, they have insight.</p>
<p class="pinkFont">Both Lee and Rachel, along with almost everyone else, are on third party platforms.  Blaming corporations who own the third party platforms is common.  Owners seem the obvious target.  It also misses the point because the owning corporations are all told what to do.  Others pull puppet strings, which makes who is doing censorship hard to see. America prepares for war.  Almost total lack of dissent, to me, is proof.  I understand that without my knowledge, everything seems fine.</p>
<p class="pinkFont">* <i>My videos came from You-Tube, but I host them here myself.  Execpt for my website host, I avoid the use of third parties on which fuckifications can be blamed.  I hope I upload my article without issue.  If you are reading this, I did.</i></p>

<p><center><span class="wheatFont"><b>No Shit</b></span></center></p>
<p class="wheatFont">May 6th, 2022</p>
<p class="wheatFont">Not enough of it anyway.  Last I checked everyone is still full of shit, but that is not enough.  We need more shit than we have.  Shit is old school fertilizer, and fertilizer the world can't do without.  Not with the world population being what it is.  Famine will result without fertilizer.</p>
<p class="wheatFont">Russia and Belarus provided almost half of world potash before the civil wars in Ukraine escalated into the Russian invasion.  Potash is an essential ingredient in fertilizer.  A huge part of world fertilizer supply came from Russia.  No more.  Sanctions stopped Russian fertilizer exports.  This will result in famine somewhere.  Americans riding with Biden may be riding a skinny horse.</p>
<p class="wheatFont">The world has eight billion people.  You can't feed eight billion people if a quarter of world fertilizer vanishes overnight.  Lack of fertilizer reduces crop yield.  Increased fertilizer cost increases food cost, and the price of food is skyrocketing.  A doubling of fertilizer cost over the last year is part of the reason it is.</p>
<p class="wheatFont">In the last year, American bacon increased in price by 28%.  I like bacon, and I am very concerned.  Covid-19 hit the bacon supply chain hard, causing the price to increase for many reasons.  Why bringing home the bacon is costs more is a complicated story.  Feed, freight and labor costs have gone up, but not only for bacon.  Everywhere food costs more.</p>
<p class="wheatFont">Modern food is fossil fuel. People do not consume  calories as they once did.  Calories came from the sun, now people eat  petro-calories along with the regular calories in food.  Oil and natural  gas became key ingredients of food decades ago.  Contemporary agricultural yields are impossible  without fertilizer.   Fertilizer comes from fossil fuels.  A salad and all other American foods use petro-calories as a key ingredient.   Petro-calories should be part of the label of ingredients on food packages.   Listed along with the regular calories already listed.</p>
<p class="wheatFont">An agricultural revolution took place in the 1960s.   A green revolution that increased agricultural yield across the globe.   Chemical fertilizers and other agrochemicals like pesticides, all made from fossil fuels were essential to the revolution.  Fossil fuels powered the green revolution in other ways as well.  Heavy mechanization,  which the green revolution required, consumes  large amounts of fossil  fuels.  Modern food is a product of oil and gas as much as Sols'  rays.</p>
<p class="wheatFont">Progress forced on the world by elite American interests put everyone in a pickle.  The 1960s green revolution grew population beyond the ability of the sun's rays to feed the world.  This made a problem.  Our agricultural systems can't run without fossil fuels now.  Once they could, but now they can't, and loss of Russian fertilizer may lead to world famine.</p>
<p class="wheatFont">Famine was going to happen anyway, perhaps in a decade or so.  Certainly within two.  I expected more of a slow, protracted slide into misery.  Not a jump off <a class="redFont" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://thesenecaeffect.blogspot.com/">Seneca's cliff</a>.  American war sanctions may prevent the world from eating very soon.</p>
<p class="wheatFont">How much do Americans understand?  Not much.   Sanctions are not considered a cause of increased food prices.</p>
<p class="wheatFont">In America, Ukraine is off the radar.  Ukraine is not taken seriously.  Recipients of  sanctions demonized, sanctions praised. "<i>Fertilizer is probably not going down for a year or more.</i>"  says Dion Letcher, a man in the fertilizer business in Minnesota.   Noting production from China, Venezuela, and Russia. Letcher adds, "<i>Because a lot of fertilizer comes from kind of dictator-y countries that kind of don't like us too much.</i>"</p>
<p class="wheatFont">But things are not that simple.  From 2020 to 2021 fertilizer prices  approximately doubled.  In the same time period U.S. natural gas  prices also doubled.  Nitrogen production uses natural gas.  Other  ingredients used in fertilizer production also consume fossil fuels.</p>
<p class="wheatFont">The agricultural revolution of the 1960s caused an increase in nitrogen fertilizer use four times over what it had been.  Modern Green revolution crop yields depend on fertilizer.  If energy cost in America climbs so does fertilizer cost.  The products are tied together.</p>
<p class="wheatFont">Russia produces 9% of global nitrogen fertilizer, 10% of global phosphate fertilizer, and 20% of global potash fertilizer. On the bottom of a giant fertilizer bag holding all the Russian fertilizer exports, a label could give 9-10-20 for the N-P-K ratio.  A ratio that makes flowers bloom.</p>
<p class="wheatFont">Russia exports more than two thirds of its production. Belarus produces 17% of total global potash and exports almost all of it.</p>
<p class="wheatFont">Predicting doom and gloom is not consistent with  American war propaganda.  Mainstream news articles say predicting  commodity prices is a fool’s errand. I do not spread American war  propaganda. I will not dilute clear cause and effect. Food cost is going  to go out of sight as crop yields drop. Yields will drop because  fertilizer is not available.</p>
<p class="wheatFont">If the price of fertilizer exceeds expected revenue from using it, fertilizer use is not profitable.  Prices of food must rise.  Fertilizer cost could become thirty percent of a farmers budget this year, double what it was a year ago.  In another year, food rationing might be necessary.</p>
<p class="wheatFont">In America, food rationing was instituted in WWII to hold down food prices.  It may happen in America again.  Across the US, more than 19.5 million households are now food insecure.  Covid-19 problems contributed to the number of food insecure.  The actual number is hard to know.</p>
<p class="wheatFont">If fertilizer remains expensive and diesel fuel cost rises to choke the American economy, the number of  people needing assistance with food will be millions more than now.  The cost of diesel is already high enough to choke the economy.</p>

<p><center><span class="violetFont"><b>Bringing the Boys Home</b></span></center></p>
<p class="violetFont">April 29th, 2022</p>
<p class="violetFont">Fred Pepper waves the stars and stripes along with a POW-MIA Vietnam vet flag over an I-405 overpass.  The overpass is a half mile from this keyboard, but the drive from the overpass to my doghouse is about two miles.  A loop up a hill.  I have talked to Fred. Fred won't rest until all the boys come home.  That is what Fred told me.  Once Fred decided to walk to Washington D.C. to tell congress about bringing the boys home.  He got a few people in local news to sponsor him.  His wife told Fred she would leave him if he went through with his trip.  Fred got as far as Colorado before the suits stopped him.  Fred and I talked about the men in the black suits.  Fred says I am one of the people who '<i>knows</i>'.  Somebody who "<i>gets it</i>".  Fred told me. "<i>We know there is no real freedom.  Most people have an illusion of freedom.  But we know better.</i>"</p>
<p class="violetFont">The thing about wives.  When they go, they don't go halfway.  Fred did half the walk, but Fred did not have half a wife after returning to Seattle.  Fred had no wife.</p>
<center class="violetFont"><video poster="./public/pics/FredPepper.png" controls="" width="600"><source src="./public/videos/FredPepper.mp4" type="video/mp4">No embedded video support</video></center>
<p class="violetFont">It was a score for me to find Fred's video.  The video is from a web search.  I figured I would find a pic of Fred because Fred is on the I-405 overpass a lot.  It is a delight to find a video instead of Fred's pic.  Local news used Fred for their own reasons.  Not that Fred minds.  Fred likes attention.</p>
<p class="violetFont">I have not talked to Fred on the overpass.  It is an American design, so the overpass has no allowance for foot traffic.  Fred is on a thin curb that is part of the pre-stressed concrete design.  I have passed Fred on a bicycle.  A bicycle ride across the overpass gets your juices flowing.  Scary.  There is a lot of traffic.  I think the overpass is being turned into a full cloverleaf.  Some kind of road construction is going on.  I-405 is always an unfinished project.  To see Fred up there is to wonder if he is going to get hurt.  I know Fred from a Renton coffee shop where I am well known.  Renton is a city four miles down the road.  Renton made all the B-17s which were used in WWII.</p>
<p class="violetFont">When I first saw Fred he was not dressed so well.   He looked like a bum.  Old faded torn and ripped leather.  Fred looked cold.  The I-405 overpass is a stones throw from the Seattle SeaHawks training field.  Staff at the training facility decided Fred should get warm.  They gave Fred jackets and clothing from the Seahawks Sports Shop.  All good designer merch.  At the store, not cheap.  It goes without saying that Fred supports the Seattle SeaHawks.  Fred is a <a class="redFont" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://www.seahawks.com/fans/the-12s/">twelve</a>.</p>
<p class="violetFont">I thought of Fred because I ran into another friend  who reminds me of Fred yesterday.  This friend has believed in times past that an invisible surveillance ball hovers over Seattle.  Alki beach to be specific.  Four feet wide and from all appearances the metallic sphere is of alien design.  I did not inquire about the ball  when we met.</p>
<p class="violetFont">My other friend is an electronic savant.  He does not understand how circuitry works like I do, but he can fix anything.  He said he recently replaced batteries in 200 hand-held army surplus rockets.  Original batteries were toast and his new ones can be recharged from a car battery.  That is what he said.  60 of the rockets went to Pakistan for providing shipping services.  If I had pointed out that Pakistan was not close to Ukraine, I know my friend would have had an answer.  That dubiousness aside.  The part about putting new batteries in hand held surplus rockets.  I believe. He was a mercinary sniper once.  In Angola.</p>
<p class="violetFont">My friend is anti-Putin but he understands other people can be misinformed.  Generally creative people are tolerant.  While we talked a stranger said :<br><br><i>"Excuse me but you guys seem well informed.  I like that. I think Putin had a stroke and he has lost his shit."</i><br><br>My friend said : <br><br><i>"One of his own team will do him in."</i></p>
<p class="violetFont">Note to self : <br><br>'Avoid conversations about Ukraine.  In America such conversations may lead to tensions which serve no good end.  People are crazy.'</p>

Domestic supply has priority.  War in Ukraine and poor harvests to blame, palm oil futures in Malaysia rose almost 10 percent.  Cooking oil is in short supply.</p>
<p class="violetFont">Willy Joseph Cancel has been cancelled.  His ticket punched.  Willy died fighting in Ukraine where he went as a military contractor.  It is claimed that Willy is a Marine veteran and if Willy were alive he could use a veterans only parking spot at a big box store.  My opinion is Willy must have been a U.S. Marine when he was sperm.  Willy was 22 years old when he died.  Speaking of sperm, Willy leaves behind a wife and seven month old son.  Willy's idea of helping people and being a good citizen and father, was to go to a foreign country and shoot bullets at other people.   In America that is how we roll.</p>
<p><center><span class="oliveFont"><b>Pax Americana</b></span></center></p>
<p class="oliveFont">April 22nd, 2022</p>
<p class="oliveFont">A time traveler on a road trip through generations of humanity would not find the Ukraine war odd.  Ukraine is another empire war.  One of many American empire wars.  The American empire has had many wars, WWI and WWII stand out, but one way or another America is always at war.  Somewhere in the world, American weapons are always killing someone.  Long lists of American military actions give time travelers something to see, no matter where in history they stop between WWII and now.  Military action, overt and covert, defends the democracy of the American dollar.  The American dollar desires to exploit humanity everywhere on the planet.  It seeks a democratic oppression.</p>
<p class="oliveFont">The American dollar prefers to conquer and dominate, using others if it can.  A low profile makes better profits.  Delay direct involvement as long as possible.</p>
<p class="oliveFont">WWI and WWII jump out from history as examples.  The American empire delayed direct involvement in WW1 and WW2 as long as it could.  Both wars had long periods of outward American neutrality before America participated in combat.  Years when the American people, Americans having no stake in the arms industry, actually were neutral.  Neutral or at least harmlessly impotent, and ignorant.</p>
<p class="oliveFont">Between August 1914 and March 1917 the United States exported 2.2 billion dollars worth of munitions to Europe. In todays' dollars, that is a lot of money.  In WWI, America was far from neutral.
<p class="oliveFont">American faux neutrality made the Imperial German Government go Putin-esk.  German unrestricted submarine warfare tried to break the transatlantic supply chain of American weapons going to Britain.</p>
<p class="oliveFont">America, not willing to have the American Dollars' supply chain disrupted, declared war on Germany.  The Creel Committee and rich money had done its work by then.  After two years of persuasion, the American people were ready to fight the Hun.<center><img src="./public/pics/shoeKaiser.png" alt="propaganda poster" width="225"></center></p>
<p class="oliveFont"><center class="oliveFont">Creel Committee Poster</center></p>
<p class="oliveFont">Then history repeated itself.  Before American combat became part of the Second World War, the American dollar was not neutral.  In January 1941 the Lend-Lease Act gave President Roosevelt power to send munitions to Britain on credit.  Transfer munitions free of charge with payment delayed.  The Lend-Lease Act necessary because Britain <a class="redFont" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="text-decoration: none;" href="http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/teachers/lesson_plans/pdfs/unit10_13.pdf">'was broke'.</a></p>
<p class="oliveFont">Munitions had been going to Britain since WWII had started for them in 1939, two years earlier.  In two years, Britain had spent all its money.  The world was on the gold standard in 1939.  Britain could not simply print money when it ran out, and Britain needed military supplies in a bad way.</p>
<p class="oliveFont">Pearl Harbor brought America into WWII as a combatant.  Six months after Pear Harbor, any lingering bad taste of the WWI Creel Committee vanished.  The United States Office of War Information was able to make sure America was solidly behind war efforts.<center><img src="./public/pics/shoeHitler.png" alt="propaganda poster" width="225"></center></p>
<p class="oliveFont"><center class="oliveFont">Office of War Information Poster</center></p>
<p class="oliveFont">Videos replace posters now.  Again, America prepares for war as the American dollar profits.  The attitude of 1916-1917 and 1940-1941 repeats again.  Send arms but stay out of the war as long as possible.  Brainwash the American Public and get them ready for inevitable combat.</p>
<p class="oliveFont">In previous world wars, supplying arms to Europe led to direct military involvement.  Argument that American military involvement was a good or bad thing aside, the American Arms Industry may be leading America into a shooting war.  Again.  History repeats.</p>
<center class="oliveFont"><video poster="./public/pics/ukrainePoster.png" controls="" width="600"><source src="./public/videos/BreakingPointTrailer.mp4" type="video/mp4">No embedded video support</video></center>
<p class="oliveFont">Pax Americana, the belief that America is not at war, may soon end.  America has known war without stop since WWII, but action is usually covert.  America is always at war somewhere.  As much as possible America maintains a public illusion of peace.  A posture that makes for steady profit.</p>
<p class="oliveFont">In previous world wars, America maintained a posture of neutrality for about two years.  Concerning Ukraine, more than two years has already passed.  The Ukraine conflict did not begin with Putin's invasion. America has been <a class="redFont" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://wallstreetwindow.com/2022/02/the-azov-battalion-and-u-s-support-of-the-ukranian-far-right-w-lev-golinkin-source-parallax-views/">supporting the Azov Battalion for years</a>.  Most Americans do not know this.  Ukraine has been an American project since the Maidan Uprising in 2014.</p>
<p class="oliveFont">I fear the flashbulb.</p>

<p class="oliveFont">* (Saturday Morning) Bad news from Texas. I was talking to someone who was there yesterday. Joe Biden and not Putin's invasion of Ukraine is why gas prices are high.  That is the popular belief.  No other reason that gas costs more now.  Texans do not not concern themselves with Ukraine.  Ukraine is not on their radar.  Biden is their problem.  In Texas brains and fertilizer are both in short supply.</p>
<p class="oliveFont">Texas and Ukraine are about the same size.  Ukraine from a twisted point of view is the Russian Texas.  In Texas, Biden, not Putin is the invader.</p>

<p><center><span class="monarchFont"><b>Free Speech My Ass</b></span></center></p>
<p class="monarchFont">April 15th, 2022</p>
<p class="monarchFont">Doom and gloom seems to be everywhere.  I don't know how you are dealing with it all.  I hope you are surviving.  I am trying to make my life work.  Swim instead of sink.  Tread water, float, survive.  Do what humans do.</p>
<p class="monarchFont">Wisdom is to control what I can.  My own life, my actions, my character.  Wisdom says do not be concerned about things I can't control.</p>
<p class="monarchFont">The next 9-11 sideshow our government has planned for us, I have no control over.  With no say in what will happen, worrying about the future is foolish.  Preparing for a great change is something I can do.  I can save money.  Drive less and spend less.  Move on to a higher paying job if I can while there is still time.</p>
<p class="monarchFont">Pollen fills the air, trees are turning green.  But today, wet snow fell.  White streaks glowed in the morning sky, vanishing as they hit the ground.  It was beautiful.  Now, sunlight softened through thin wispy clouds make blossoming trees glow.  Apple and cherry.  Change is in the air, but winter does not want to let go.</p>
<p class="monarchFont">Summer will be warm. Todays' confusion temporary.  Spring will chase winter away.  I hope the nations' confusion about Russia is also temporary.  I hope this April confusion does not become an American war with the same certainty of coming summer.  Certainties we know are death and taxes, and this April is the month for both.  April is tax time, that certainty I dealt with last week.  About death, my preference is not to deal with it if I can avoid it.  It does not have to be a certainty this month.  If anyone asks, I say no more war.  Please, no more death.</p>
<p class="monarchFont">I am an anti-war person.  I have been that way for a long time.  My views make me aware of other anti-war voices.  I have a radar that listens to what they say.  Anti-war Americans with strong opinions.  Americans who give talks, write articles, and in other ways dissent from 'my country right or wrong' nonsense.  People of conscience who stand up for what they think is right.  Some of these people I have followed since the Occupy Movement, and some sooner.  Voices of dissent who think deep.</p>
<p class="monarchFont">Deplatformed from You-Tube now they are.  Years of interviews and video deleted from search results.  Algorithms now distribute pro-war American propaganda instead.  Propaganda distributed in ways that would make the former <a class="redFont" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://www.mutualart.com/Article/The-Art-of-Propaganda--The-Creel-Committ/0C4AEDBCC6A8E2A5">Creel Committee </a><span class="greenFont">green </span>with envy.  America marches to war.  I fear the flashbulb.</p>
<p class="monarchFont">The Ukraine war is not confined inside the borders of Ukraine.  This war reaches out to the whole world.  The war's greatest suffering, the death, the maiming, remains inside Ukraine.  But parts of the war reach out everywhere like an evil octopus.  Cthulhu rises.  The first universal casualty seen in America is truth.  Suppression of intellectual critique, bombardment by pro-war anti-Putin propaganda memes.  Quickly it happened, and now twisted truths fill social media.</p>
<p class="monarchFont">Truth was first, but America's poor are a second casualty of the Ukraine war.  I put gasoline in my car yesterday and paid $95.00.  More than a full work shift for some American wage slaves now.  A four-hour shift for the majority of the other wage slaves.  American food cost is becoming high.  And the poor here are not making any more money.  The unfortunate who struggle to get by must struggle harder.</p>
<p class="monarchFont">Covid made people sick, miserable, and worse.  Social disruption that covid brought made another kind of misery.  A new social disruption as destructive as covid would be the end for people with covid frayed nerves.  A two-fer double whammy.  People who already are at the end of their rope will lose their grip.  Avoiding the war in Ukraine would be a wise choice for America.  America does not need the pain.  Only rich cheerleaders of capitalism and their wannabees want war with Russia.</p><p class="monarchFont">I'll guess people in Ukraine would like the war over quickly.  I know I do.  People should get back to living real lives.  American involvement can only prolong the misery and death of the Ukraine shitshow.</p>
<p class="monarchFont">Anxiety and depression among kids and teens surged during the pandemic.  War will not bring these kids any healing.  Youth suffer, and most Americans have less than $1000 in savings. Americans were having a tough time squirrelling money away for a rainy day before the pandemic.  Now fuel costs from the Ukraine war make the cost of everything go up.  Tough times are ahead.</p>

<p><center><span class="pinkFont"><b>Up And Down But Always Up</b></span></center></p>
<p class="pinkFont">April 8th, 2022</p>
<p class="pinkFont">At the rate oil is now burned, Carbon Dioxide in the air goes up half a percent a year.  The reality is a bit more than that.  Half a percent rounds down, but is easier to talk about.</p>
<p class="pinkFont">Every month I track atmospheric CO2.  Every month I calculate the percentage increase from the same month last year.</p>
<p class="pinkFont">You can see my calculation on top of my visitor globe on the right side of this page.  The calculation has been consistent at about 0.6 percent a year for several years.  This month is a significant anomaly.  The increase is the smallest increase I have ever calculated, at only half the normal rate.  I have made my calculation at least 100 times.  I can't remember when I started doing it, and this calculation jumps out from the others.</p>
<p class="pinkFont">The smallest increase would be great news if the change were man made, but it is not, and there is an explanation.  This time of year, the Northern Hemisphere turns green.  Plants lower CO2 concentration in the air when they grow.</p>
<p class="pinkFont">The Northern Hemisphere has more land area turning green than the Southern Hemisphere does over a year.  Plant death in the Southern Hemisphere increases CO2 at the same time the northern spring decreases it, but plant growth in the Northern Hemisphere absorbs more CO2 than is released by the Southern Hemisphere.</p>
<p class="pinkFont">A natural dip in CO2 concentration occurs every year.  Winter months always have a higher CO2 concentration than summer months.  When fall comes, CO2 plants absorbed in spring and summer returns when plants die and decompose.</p>
<p class="pinkFont">Every month compared to the same month a year ago shows about a half percent increase.  The effect of the annual fluctuation filters out.  Only month to month does concentration ever go down.  Comparing a month to a month one year ago always shows an increase.  This month at 0.28% is the first significant departure from the nominal half a percent increase I regularly observe.</p>
<p class="pinkFont">The Earth is warming.  Spring comes sooner now.  Spring happens faster because more CO2 in the air makes plants grow faster.  Also because the earth is warmer, spring is sooner.</p>
<p class="pinkFont">People with greenhouses know CO2 concentration affects plant growth.  CO2 concentration in greenhouses artificially increased accelerates growth.  Plant growth increases when extra CO2 is added until  concentrations of about 1000 parts per million are reached.  Beyond this concentration, returns diminish, and CO2 begins to be toxic.</p>
<p class="pinkFont">The pandemic produced a temporary decrease in the increase, but that effect is gone.  The consistent half a percent a year increase returned, and that is bad news.</p>
<p class="pinkFont">The Earth is warming faster than people realize.  The natural fluctuation in CO2 concentration between winter and summer hides a steady climb.  A climb which over decades has accelerated.  Most added CO2 has been added in the last thirty years.</p>
<p class="pinkFont">Nothing is going to be done to mitigate climate change.  The rate at which CO2 is put in the air does not decline.  Doom is baked in the cake.</p>
<p class="pinkFont">If oil is not used, the world starves.  Mitigation could have started years ago.  Now nothing can be done.  There are too many people who need to eat.  The only way to feed them is by energy intensive industrial farming.  Intensive use of fossil fuel with the belief that dinosaur juice supplies are endless, and will last forever.</p>
<p class="pinkFont">The green revolution or third agricultural revolution <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="text-decoration: none;" class="redFont" href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/714444">increased yields by 44% between 1965 and 2010.</a></p>
<p class="pinkFont">Green revolution farming is energy intensive.  Modern green revolution farming depends on fossil fuels, which now become too expensive to use.  Modern farming along with medical care also overpopulated the world.</p>
<p class="pinkFont">It was a slowly evolving situation, but the NATO war in Ukraine bumped things forward a few years.  Now, starvation is possible for some people as soon as this year.  Some food prices will go up <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="text-decoration: none;" class="redFont" href="https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2022/04/05/german-supermarkets-substantially-raise-food-prices/">thirty to fifty percent this week in Germany.</a>  In America, everybody knows the cost of food is going up.  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="text-decoration: none;" class="redFont" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-manure-is-hot-commodity-amid-commercial-fertilizer-shortage-2022-04-06/">Fertilizer cost</a> has doubled everywhere, and everybody knows the cost of fuel has gone up since we all use it.</p>
<p class="pinkFont">Windmills and graphs.  None of it matters.  Put all the things people do to fight climate change in a big black box.  Close the lid and lock it down.  Now everything in the box is out of sight and out of mind, but the calculation on top of my visitor globe still shows CO2 going up.  Every month it goes up and it never comes down.  The rate is alarming, and the rate is what matters.  The rate of increase tells the story of our future as clearly as any essay by Thomas Malthus can. People will starve.  If not this year, soon.</p>

<p class="wheatFont">April 1st, 2022</p>
<p class="wheatFont">Internet police are real.  Censorship is real.  Censorship created this page and on this page, censorship should be impossible.  I am the author, webmaster and only contributor here.  There is no one else.  Yet, sometimes shit happens.  Content temporarily posted on this page in place of my own.  Content revealing personal surveillance of me.  Mental violence, as hurtful as a slap to the face.  The '<i>Ministry of Love</i>' at work.  The '<i>Ministry of Love</i>' is not know by many.  Those who have felt the love know the '<i>Ministry of Love</i>' is real.  To most other people, the '<i>Ministry of Love</i>' does not appear to exist.  In contrast, the existence of the '<i>Ministry of Truth</i>'  becomes obvious to all.  First, it was persecution of anti-vax points of view.  Now voices critical of the mainstream Ukrainian war narrative make '<i>Ministry of Truth</i>' activity obvious.  Dissident voices are suppressed. </p>
<p class="wheatFont">Over the weekend, six years of video vanished from YouTube.  Six years of video from the show 'On Contact' hosted by Chris Hedges removed.  'On Contact' was hosted by Russia Today, which viewers knew as RT.  RT no longer exists.  RT has shut down, a consequence of the Ukraine war.  The removed archived video covered many topics.  Chris is not a mouthpiece for Russia.  Chris Hedges is critical of Putin.</p>
<p class="wheatFont">RT had a nice green logo and I liked the reporting.  Most of  RT's reporting consisted of balanced inquiry into contemporary issues at an intellectual level beyond the level of most mainstream media.</p>
<p class="wheatFont">I watched Chris on his 'On Contact' show.  I liked the show.  Chris is a thinking man of conscience.  RT gave Chris full editorial control, and Chris spoke his mind.  Chris is anti-war, critical of American foreign policy and a dissident.  The show was honest.  Chris will not be hosted on any mainstream media platform.  Mainstream media will not have him.  The American Empire does not care for uncomfortable truth.  Who does?</p>
<p class="wheatFont">Inflating gas prices and the Ukraine war dominated the news before Will Smith slapped Chris Rock at the Oscars.  The Will Smith slap happened days ago, but news about the slap remains big.  Having an opinion about the slap, unlike the Ukraine war or anything else, seems to be important.  Having an opinion about the Will Smith slap might count for something, unlike having an opinion about the war.  This may have something to do with it.  Repression of incorrect opinions about the Ukraine war is happening.  Unlike national policy, public opinion could make a difference concerning the Will Smith slap.  A comment on the subject might not disappear.</p>
<p class="wheatFont">There is no excuse for violence, and Will Smith should be charged with assault.  Chris Rock does not need to make a complaint for an assault charge to be filed.</p>
<p class="wheatFont">Will Smith committed a crime in front of millions of people.  Los Angeles by doing nothing sends a message.  A bad message.  Rich celebrity can commit crime without fear of punishment.</p>
<p class="wheatFont">Charges are routinely filed without cooperation from crime victims.  Crime is against the state for violating penal codes, and not against a victim from the legal point of view.  Criminal charges are routine in domestic violence cases without a cooperating victim.  When police are called to investigate domestic violence, they are obligated to arrest someone if they find evidence of violence.  Victims have no say, someone goes to jail.</p>
<p class="wheatFont">Will Smith would get off with a <i>slap on the wrist.</i>  That is true.  But the point is, Will Smith would not get off altogether.  Smith would be held to account.</p>
<p class="wheatFont">Picking up trash along the freeway with a nail on a stick for a day and paying the $5000 fine would not hurt Will Smith at all.  But it is clear the rich and powerful receive a different brand of justice in Los Angeles.  An average person would be judged crazy and arrested if they slapped Chris Rock at the Oscars.  Will Smith is crazy, but unlike an average Joe, Will's crazy excuses his slapping of Chris Rock's face.  Will's crazy is not reason to arrest him, as it should be, but reason to excuse him.</p>
<p class="wheatFont">Everybody married or in a relationship can understand how Jada Smith made Will Smith lose his mind.  Jada's 'entanglement' with another man understandably pained Will.  Making the beast with two backs is an entanglement for sure.  Jada's entanglement understandably put Will on edge.  Jada's entanglement drove Will crazy.  But a woman driving a man crazy is no excuse for slapping anybody.  No matter how crazy a woman makes you, a man must remember, women have been driving men crazy since the dawn of time.  For some women, driving men crazy is their full time job, and they are skilled at it.  Don't be like that.</p>
<p class="wheatFont">The crazy a woman can make a man feel is strong, but it is also a crazy a man can decide not to have.  Will Smith needs to learn this.  If his feelings of rage, desperation, and being sucked into a bottomless hole can't be stopped, acting on them can be.</p>

<p><center><span class="violetFont"><b>Team Z</b></span></center></p>
<p class="violetFont">March 25th, 2022</p>
<p class="violetFont">It looks like a sports team rally.  In Seattle, the Seahawks inspire blue and green truck mounted flags when the team is in playoffs.  Same sized flags.  But a Trump truck Trump rally is a better match.</p>
<p class="violetFont">The video below and others like it are easy to find.  I used a Russian search engine.  Is the video propaganda?  Answering a question with a question is not nice, but do bears shit in the woods?  Of course bears do.  The video is propaganda.  So is FOX, CNN, NBC and everyone else most people watch.</p>
<p class="violetFont">I saw a cartoon of George Orwell in bug-eyed shock.  People wide-eyed with emotion are easy to draw in cartoons.  George is holding a book with the title, 2022.  George's totalitarian nightmare is here, and as the planet warms, a smell of rot fills the air.</p>
<p class="violetFont"></p>
<p class="violetFont"><center><video poster="./public/pics/orwell2022.png" controls="" width="240" height="135"><source src="./public/videos/SeattleSeahawksRally.mp4" type="video/mp4">No embedded video support</video></center></p>
<p class="violetFont">I do not speak Russian.  I would like to learn.  There are a lot of things I would like to do.  One of the men in the video said 'chickenfat'.  I do not think he was discussing a cooking recipe.  Likely it is a coincidence. But how would I know?  I do not speak Russian.</p>
<p class="violetFont">The idea of using a foreign search engine to get a different perspective will not occur to most people.  If they think about it, they will not want to see Russian Propaganda anyway.  What is the point?</p>
<p class="violetFont">I know I heard Putin's name in the dialog.  Perhaps everyone attending the rally got a free fill up before they assembled for the parade?  Regardless, '<i>Make Russia Great Again</i>' seems to be a thing.  The video was for Russians to see.  The truck parade could be the largest ever, with a record turnout.  Regardless, almost nobody in America will know.  American propaganda tells a different story.</p>
<p class="violetFont">All propaganda, all news, distorts the truth.  Successful propaganda twists truth into desired shape.  Fake reality woven from whole cloth does not make good propaganda if lies can be discovered.  Checking facts reveal contradictions in propaganda.  Free speech is capable of defeating propaganda if people listen to dissident voices who check facts.  But only if people care about issues and care to listen for truth.  Free speech by itself does not defeat propaganda.  Good character is also needed.</p>
<p class="violetFont">In George Orwell's 1984 and in our 2022, totalitarian control defeats free speech.  Propaganda controls the narrative.  Ubiquity and repetition of message cover over contradictions caused when propaganda changes with time and adapts to events.  The psychology of humans makes repetition and ubiquity of message effective.  If a single story gets repeated over and over, people will believe it.  They can't help themselves.  It has to do with being a social animal.  Social memory is short.</p>
<p class="violetFont"><center><img src="./public/pics/sheep.png" alt="picture of sheep" width="225"></center></p>
<p class="violetFont">Comparing people to sheep is unfair to sheep.  People are capable of reason.  People often do not use reason, it is a choice.  So people frequently live like sheep by choice.  People mostly allow emotion to control thought, action and feeling.  People can reason, but people choose not to reason most of the time.  That is the difference.  Sheep live according to their nature, as it should be.  Sheep do what sheep do.  Sheep can't be any other way.</p>
<p class="violetFont"><center><video poster="./public/pics/orwell2022.png" controls="" width="240" height="135"><source src="./public/videos/TrumpParade.mp4" type="video/mp4">No embedded video support</video></center></p>
<p class="violetFont"><center>( Play the previous video at the same time for music. )</center></p>
<p class="violetFont">Should people live according to their nature and use reason?  From a practical point of view, sheep don't kill each other and people do.  This makes me think avoiding the crowd, and thinking like the crowd, is a good and reasonable idea.  Using reason is human nature.  Not to use reason is living the life of an animal.</p>
<p class="violetFont">George Orwell's world of 1984 divides into Oceania, Eastasia, and Eurasia.  Nowhere is there freedom and prosperity.  Conflict is a normal part of life.  The real world of 2022 is no different.  And the <i>1984 'Ministry of Truth'</i> is everywhere watching everything we do.  Freedom is locked down and reason atrophies.</p>
<p><center><span class="oliveFont"><b>Three Days Off</b></span></center></p>
<p class="oliveFont">March 18th, 2022</p>
<p class="oliveFont">A short trip.  A short escape.  I take three days off.  I requested days off a month ago.  Somewhere, a computer arranged five and six-day weeks for a job that keeps me under thirty-two hours a week.  An American associate in big retail can't work more than thirty-two hours a week.  This avoids benefits.   Five and six-day weeks for the last two weeks.  Trading hours between weeks.  Covering days off for a replacement.  A replacement silently moved to take my place this weekend.  A computer god does all the planning so it is difficult to get three days off in a row.  Things should not be so difficult at a part-time job.  Not the kind of job I have.  But I have no say so I deal with it and move on.</p>
<p class="oliveFont">I won't compare my situation to slavery.  Slaves were beaten, slaves could not quit.  Slavery is horrible.  I can't imagine any social arrangement more exploitative than slavery.  Exploitation did not end with slavery abolished, and exploitation continues.  But exploitation of a different kind.  Slavery is pernicious and nothing compares to slavery, except prison life.</p>
<p class="oliveFont">Most people are slaves to money.  Exploitation continues.  Money exploits, but money also buys freedom.  Without money being a slave would be a better deal.  Without money you starve.  Being owned by bad people was horrible.  Horrible now is to be without money.  At the end of the Holocene, where we are, everything is artificial and controlled by money.  Life as a hunter and gatherer even part time is no longer an option.  Not for most people.  Beg, steal, or die if you don't have money.  wthey It makes things better.  Financially, I am not rich, but I am not poor.  I am free.  Most of the time I am free.  I work to be free with some success.</p>
<p class="oliveFont">As a thinking person, there is more to it than the money.  "From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs".  I can't help but think about the meaning of what I do.  Beyond my needs, I have ability.  I can contribute.  So I do.  The wolf is not at my door today, but I am a thread in the social fabric.  Contributing surplus value to the social fabric is something I want to do.  Does my work do this?  As things are, I do not think so.  Perhaps thinking this way is a fairy tale to you, and not your monkey.</p>
<p class="oliveFont">America is capitalism.  A small minority of people own the means of production.  This minority make all decisions about using the means of production.  Labor is a commodity.  Labor has no say in capitalism.  The minority gets smaller every day.</p>
<p class="oliveFont">I have the luxury to think about these things.  Some people, people who need 'two jobs' just to get by with nothing left over, these people are paid what I am earning now.  But I only need one of their two jobs to get by on.  I do not complain.  I am posing, sort of.  My problems are not so bad.</p>
<p class="oliveFont">Making my money the way 'two job' people make money makes me see money differently.  I stop for lunch.  I think of how much time I must work to pay for my lunch.  I stop to fill up my gas tank, I need 92 octane so I see my entire paycheck for a short shift shown on the gas pump display.  The five cents a gallon saved using grocery member points does not amount to much.  Grocery membership points.  I'd rather everyone have cheaper groceries.</p>
<p class="oliveFont">People in less fortunate circumstances than mine must be having a very hard time now.  Not having any job at all would even be worse.  Capitalism as we know it requires unemployment.</p>
<p class="oliveFont">America is collapsing.  Most people will never own a home.  Priced out of a market where real estate giants buy whole neighborhoods, home ownership as Americans have known it is dead. Renting is the new norm, and without a job, a person can not rent.  No pictures on future walls, no pets for an average man.  Nothing to call your own.  The specter of homelessness always near.</p>
<p class="oliveFont">Through age or sickness, some people can't work.  Social security is not enough, and Wall Street did a pretty good job eating the average guy's 401 K over the years.  People who own homes have homes that now fall apart.</p>
<p class="oliveFont">This is not a good time to lose your shit in America.  Sadly, many people are losing their shit.  I do not blame them.  First COVID and now war.  Delusions abound.  It is hard to know what to do in American collapse.  I admit at times in my life I have been clueless.  These are not good times to be clueless.</p>
<p class="oliveFont">I was lucky.  I can learn and I experienced the best American public education could give in the 20th century.  I learned to learn on my own.  As an adult, I was sad to learn my education experience was not the average experience.  My normal turned out to be above average.</p>
<p class="oliveFont">My education made me into a science guy, and I noticed early that math was not used for making big decisions.  As it should be used.  Money I noticed does not prefer wisdom, and exponential growth resulted.  Now, the world as we know it must end.  There are consequences.  But today the world does not end.</p>
<p class="oliveFont">Today, I can live a good life.  Tomorrow will come when it does.  Today I can enjoy my escape.</p>
<p class="oliveFont"></p>
<p><center><span class="pinkFont"><b>Driving Home</b></span></center></p>
<p class="pinkFont">March 11th, 2022</p>
<p class="pinkFont">I can't respect anything my government or American media says about Putin and his war.  I woke up yesterday to the sound of American news. '<i>Putin won't stop at Ukraine, Putin is like Hitler.  If Putin is not stopped Putin will start WWIII.</i>'  I somewhat agree.</p>
<p class="pinkFont">Putin likes dogs.  Hitler liked dogs.  There is a similarity I agree.  I like dogs too.</p>
<p class="pinkFont">Listening to the news I am reminded that there is nothing new under the sun.  The memory of Vietnam and thousands of young American boys killed by the American empire is dim.  The video game war of shock and awe also dim.  The quagmire in Afghanistan, dim.  A quagmire that came to and end only last year.  A quagmire now forgotten.  War dogs are wagging tails.  There is much barking.</p>
<p class="pinkFont">Nothing new under the sun.  Delusion as usual.  The belief that life can go on as it did before.  Before what?  That once there was a thing called normal to return to.  But there never was a normal, and hang onto your seats.  The ride is going to get rough.</p>
<p class="pinkFont">I left work at 11 PM last night.  The night air was cold and crisp. A quarter mile out of the parking lot, down the hill.  I reach my left turn.  Diagonally across the intersection, new brightly lit gas pumps sell gas at $4.89 a gallon.  My trip home will cost me $3.00 at that price.  If I only go to and from work this will not be a problem.  Not yet.  I pass three grocery stores on the way to and from work.  I can get by paying thirty bucks a week on gas.  Not that I do, but I could, and I should.</p>
<p class="pinkFont">I should because CO2 is at 419.28 parts per million now.  Get ready to smoke the bowl.  We should be doing what we can to keep the climb on this number slow.  I try and drive less.  My desire to do the right thing  bolstered with real practical knowledge that driving costs money.  Drive less, enjoy it more is my motto.  On the way to work I have a favorite mile.</p>
<p class="pinkFont">I miss driving.  In times of trouble, escaping the city on a long drive cleared my mind many a time.  And I confess in the last few months I put on more emotional miles than I should have.  I won't beat myself up about it.  I keep track of the CO2 parts per million in the top right corner of this web page.  I have been tracking CO2 for a few years.  There was a brief slowdown at the beginning of the pandemic but the climb is back on.  Full steam. Doom baked in the cake.  The human population will not be able to feed itself in a few years.</p>
<p class="pinkFont">When oil and natural gas prices increase, the price of nitrogen fertilizer increases.  Putin's war will push millions into chronic malnutrition.  In a few years energy depletion will do the same thing.  Millions will die.</p>
<p class="pinkFont">America is the land of stagnant wages and rising prices.  Now prices must rise faster.  That first statement is perhaps too sweeping, but it applies to the exploited demographic.  Wages of exploiters continue to rise.  So it goes.</p>
<p class="pinkFont">I don't know how people are taking all this.  Ukraine has taken climate catastrophe off the news.  I backed off from online activity.  I am isolated.  At work I am all about my job.  It is a personal self discipline thing.</p>
<p class="pinkFont">I learn about my co-workers slowly.  Men don't talk much.  There are no women where I work and our customers are ten men for every woman.  We do not have sexual discrimination.  We sell tools.  Tools are heavy.  If you can throw a sixty pound box onto a shelf seven feet high you can do the job.</p>
<p class="pinkFont">Last night was a night of heavy lifting.  Replenishment of isle stock from the warehouse.  Large items on my list.  Hefting the 10 gallon boxed air compressor or the 12 inch crosscut saw in an equally large box.  I don't know what was more challenging.  It was a tie.  I do not move cosmetics.  Boxes of solid steel like lynch pins or boxes of chain are the heaviest for their size.  I try and not hurt myself.  The next truck is in two days.</p>
<p class="pinkFont">One of my co-workers told me he would need three sleeping bags in his van for the night.  When it gets into the twenties he needs to sleep inside three sleeping bags.  Getting up in the morning is the hard part he says.  Being triple bagged is very warm.  He parks in a safe place where local residents like having him around.</p>
<p class="pinkFont">* I measured mileage home to work, and paid $5.79 a gallon to top off my tank on the way today.  My credit card was Putinified.  I revise my estimate for gas to forty dollars minimum a week.</p>
<p><center><span class="monarchFont"><b>Road Hazard</b></span></center></p>
<p class="monarchFont">March 4th, 2022</p>
<p class="monarchFont">War is a crime.  Perhaps you have changed your tone of voice in the last few days.  Spontaneous excited utterances directed at people you are close to.  No clear reason.  If so, you are not alone.  Stress is up.  Weary from the pandemic now we have new trouble, war.  Millions of people, stalked by terror, are on the move.</p>  
<p class="monarchFont">I filled my gas tank at $4.73 today with a twenty cent a gallon discount.  The war is half a world away, but the war affects the whole world.  I will be keeping my gas tank full, thankful I am not in Ukraine.  Anxiety everywhere.  I don't anticipate a gas shortage, but keeping my tank full makes me feel better.  Something I can control.</p>
<p class="monarchFont">Why were there plans to make Ukraine part of NATO?  As a former part of the Soviet Union, such plans threaten Russia directly.   That does not make what Putin is doing now right.  But plans for NATO in the Ukraine made Russian invasion inevitable.</p>
<p class="monarchFont">The reason NATO needed to be In the Ukraine is because the arms industry needs to grow.  The military industrial complex sets policy.  Nuclear submarines are ready to glass any country on the globe at any moment.  Having NATO in the Ukraine serves no purpose.</p>
<p class="monarchFont">Kiev has an average working wage of $918 / month, the highest average wage of any city in Ukraine. Russian salaries average $1402 / month. A simple comparison hides many details, but what do Ukrainians have to fight for?  At the end of the day, how well has the Ukrainian worker done?
<p class="monarchFont">Which oligarch is worth dying for.  That could be a question, but a trick question since no oligarch is worth dying for.  Forced to choose, I'd choose an oligarch that lets me earn $1400 a month.  My choice in actually would be not to make the choice.  I am a pacifist.  Regarding military activities, I say no.</p>
<p class="monarchFont">The American knee-jerk reaction is to support Ukraine.  Having a comedian as national leader is the natural order of the universe in America.  America always puts clowns in charge.  Zelenskyy, a strong face of resistance, becomes more popular.  But this is war, and not a mixed martial arts MMA match.  Zelenskyy, the face of  strong resistance, may be killing Ukrainians in useless resistance. Despite death, ignoring death, Zelenskyy's expression of manly mojo  has  western media squirming with delight.</p>
<p class="monarchFont">As a man, Volodymyr Zelenskyy may be fine.  I don't know him.  Russia will occupy Ukraine.  Western news reports no current details about the conflict.  This silence suggests to me Putin is accomplishing his goals.  A good thing if a swift end to the conflict leads to the smallest loss of life.</p>
<p class="monarchFont">As a man, Putin may be fine too.  I don't know him.  Putin clearly acts in the best interest of Russia, the country.  Putin's concern for Russian people is debatable.  I am not doing that.  Putin wants to make Russia, the country, more powerful.  Western corruption gave Putin an opportunity.  Putin can't say no to opportunity.  That he can't say no to opportunity should surprise nobody. The western military industrial complex gave Putin opportunity.</p>
<p class="monarchFont">As we drive the freeway of life, traffic slows.  Up ahead Putin in a gold trimmed State troopers smokey bear hat, directs traffic around a car wreck.  The car, a two toned canary yellow coup with blue hardtop, ran off the road wrapping itself around a power pole.  There appear to be injuries.  Everybody is driving slow.  There is sadness as people drive past.  The driver of the car cited for recklessly speeding into the future.  Ignoring existing road conditions, and corrupt pole placement.</p>
<p class="monarchFont">Putin holds up a hand, motioning me to stop.  This could make me late for work.  I must wait while a tow-truck clears the wreck.  The tow-truck driver moves with plodding lethargic motion.  My anxiety climbs with his slow tired movements.  I need my finger on the time clock.  For that I need to be at work.  Every minute delayed is worth thirty cents.  I need to pay for my tank of gas.</p>
<p class="monarchFont">The tow-truck driver puts red tow lights with  magnetic bases on the trunk of the wrecked car.  Bending over a Biden  bumper sticker, he places the lights.  Next to the bumper sticker,  across the top of the license plate holder it says, 'I Luv Ukraine'.  A  red heart is in place of 'Luv'.  The chrome palm trees on the sides of  the license plate frame are out of place.  Putin motions, and finally I  move again.  This wreck is going to cost me two dollars.  I need the  hours.  I am not happy.   Thinking the sky over the city could light up  like a camera photo-flash does not make me happier.  I think of the  hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians who have lost everything.  Here I am worrying about two dollars.  I am ashamed.</p>
<p class="monarchFont">Past the wreck I am like everyone else again.  I worry about my own problems and my own world. My own problems are all I know  about.  The news I can't trust.  All I can do is mind my own business, fly right, and be a straight arrow.</p>
<p class="monarchFont">Madness is around me.  I know I can't expect more of the world.  Mad the world is, and mad the world will continue to be.  I try to avoid being one of the insane.</p>

<p class="wheatFont">The American Petroleum Institute, considering the Ukraine situation, advocates opening federal lands for oil production.  Issue drilling permits, and anything resembling a regulation be round filed.  Drill offshore and build pipelines like there is no tomorrow.</p>
<p class="wheatFont">Who could have known the Hunter Biden laptop and the 2014 color revolution would lead to all this?  The good thing is the American embarrassments mute saber-rattling against Putin's occupation of Ukraine.  Putin acts to keep nuclear missiles out of the former breadbasket of the Soviet Union, and the breadbasket with its rich soils returns to Russia.  It all makes sense to Russia, and I hope death stops soon.</p>
<p class="wheatFont">Yesterday I had the misfortune to listen to a radio broadcast of NPR and American anti-Russian propaganda.  I was driving.  I managed to push the 'seek' button on my radio fast enough to find music and avoid throwing up.  The thought came to me that a person would have to be stupid and totally out to lunch to take anything <b>N</b>ational <b>P</b>etroleum <b>R</b>adio was saying seriously, but it does not matter.  I doubt most Americans take NPR propaganda seriously anyway.  Most Americans who have any mental horsepower know that NPR went over to the dark side decades ago.</p>
<p class="wheatFont">Not that it matters if anybody knows how NPR became the mouthpiece for American propaganda, or if the propaganda is true or false.  The point of NPR is to cultivated compliance, and belief does not matter.  What matters is people are passive, taking no action to prevent lies from being taken as truth.  NPR cultivates a passive ideology of apathy, and apathy is compliance.</p>
<p class="wheatFont">The pandemic brought uncomfortable truths to light.  Common misunderstandings about freedom showed most people 'concerned' about global heating actually are not concerned.  Disaffected people who don't understand issues in depth affect faux outrage.  I make the mistake of thinking other people think as I do.  Now more uncomfortable truths come to light, revealed by the Ukraine occupation.  The number of people revealing themselves to possess shallow understandings grows.</p>
<p class="wheatFont">Call it whatever 'ism' you will.  Money rules the planet, and rich people have money.  Most people are poor.  Police and military keep the rich rich and the poor poor.  That is the existing arrangement.  Force keeps existing arrangements the way they are.  Whatever they are.  Division between rich and poor is maintained.  That is the status quo which power maintains.   Bullets are an effective and overt expression of power.  Bullets or police with crowd control zip-tie handcuffs and tear gas.  These are examples of overt control, and overt control maintains existing arrangements.</p>
<p class="wheatFont">But the existing arrangement needs more control to be free of revolution.  Overt control is not enough.  Overt control can be challenged, so money controls what people see, read, and hear.  Money controls public perception.  Jeff Bezos owns the Washington Post, and Jeff is only one example of wealth owning power.  Money owns mass media, defining perception of the present moment.  Schools, religion, and other institutions provide ideology, a lazy and canned perception ready for all moments.  Money controls what is taught, and to whom it is taught.  Money brainwashes everyone.  And most Americans can't find Ukraine on a map.</p>
<p class="wheatFont">Nowhere in America is there any mention of Ukrainian self-determination or what is good for the Ukrainian people.  Money does not want you to know anything about Ukrainians.</p>
<p class="wheatFont"> Armed conflict in the baby twins of Donetsk and Lugansk in the Donbass region of eastern Ukraine, started in 2014. The Donbass conflict has since killed over 14,000 people.  If Putin puts an end to the Donbass conflict, Russia is not an invader.  Russia becomes a peacemaker.</p>
<p class="wheatFont">Putin's demands were to have The Crimea recognized as Russian, which it is. Demilitarize the Ukraine, declare it neutral, becoming a Black Sea Switzerland.  Abandon plans to join NATO.  Russia wants security.  Who does not?</p>
<p class="wheatFont">Americans don't consider the Russian perspective.  There is no mention in America of the Ukrainian Civil War.  In America, the breakaway republics of Donetsk and Lugansk are unknown.</p>
<p class="wheatFont">Instead, Putin is a demon and condemned in any way possible.  Hating on Russia is a popular and socially acceptable American pastime.  Internet psychologists and others accuse Putin of being mentally ill.  I find it all disgusting.  Vague claims of Putin being a bad person pass as facts.  Actual facts go missing.</p>
<p class="wheatFont">I am not an apologist for Putin.  I don't know much more about Putin than most Americans do, which is nothing.  But unlike everyone else, I admit my ignorance.  I know a little more than nothing, and that is all.</p>
<p class="wheatFont">According to Patriots owner Robert Kraft, Putin stole his Super Bowl ring.  I don't care.  If death in the Donbass ends and the Ukrainian, Russian, Donetsk, and Lugansk peoples can live in peace, I won't be hating on Putin no matter how popular hating on Putin becomes.  Peace is worth a $20,000 Superbowl ring.</p>
<p class="wheatFont">Hating on Putin is disgustingly popular.  Facts about the Ukraine situation are not optional, in America facts about the Ukraine situation are unknown and eschewed.  In America, actual knowledge of Russia and its relationship to the Ukraine is next to zero.  Actual facts don't support the American narrative.  In America, every means is employed to preserve ignorance.</p>

<p class="pinkFont">February 18th, 2022</p>
<p class="pinkFont">Trudeau invokes Canada’s Emergencies Act and tows trucks.  It ain’t no party, it ain’t no disco.  Trudeau ain’t fooling around, and the Canadian insurrection ends.  I would not want to be an arrested trucker.  Consequences will be harsh.</p>
<p class="pinkFont">Trucks are the wheels of fossil fuel civilization, or modern life as we know it.  Fossil fuels do everything.  Fossil fuels grow food with help from the sun.  The sun can't do it alone.  Pesticides made from fossil fuels allow crops to grow, and farm machines use internal combustion engines.  After it is grown, trucks ship food.  Diesel motors drag logs from forests, trucks take logs to sawmills.  Wood from sawmills hauled on trucks build shelter.  Clothing from diesel powered ships fills distribution centers and stores across the country, all shipped by trucks.  Trucks are essential to the function of modern life.  Without trucking, modern life stops.  Modern life depends on the diesel engine.</p>
<p class="pinkFont">Mischief will not be tolerated.  We have no horses.  But if we had horses it would not help because now we have too many people.  Now all we have are trucks.  Fossil fuels forced exponential population growth.  Now we don't have land enough for horses even if we had them.</p>
<p class="pinkFont">Canada has trucking problems, but America has trucking problems of its own.  Unlike the Canadian drama, the American trucking issue is not big news.  The United States government needs to keep truck wheels turning as a matter of strategic importance.  People need to eat and profits must be made.</p>
<p class="pinkFont">The Federal Register website <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="text-decoration: none;" class="redFont" href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2019/05/15/2019-09944/commercial-drivers-licenses-pilot-program-to-allow-drivers-under-21-to-operate-commercial-motor">'The Daily Journal of the United States Government'</a> documents the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="text-decoration: none;" class="redFont" href="https://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/">FMCSA</a>  acting to protect trucking as a strategic asset.  The first red link explains the age limit for truckers is reduced so military soldiers who are often 18, 19 or 20 years old can drive trucks across state lines.  Why would there be such a need?</p>
<p class="pinkFont">I won't speculate.  That was then and this is now.  Covid changed things.  The FMCSA filed their notice to satisfy their perceived military need on 05/15/2019.  We have covid and supply chain issues now, and things have changed.  The restriction you be 21 or over to drive a big rig across the United States is removed as part of the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="text-decoration: none;" class="redFont" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/bipartisan-infrastructure-law/">Bipartisan Infrastructure Plan.</a>  Covid made a shortage of truckers.  Laid off or with reduced hours, capitalism kicked truckers to the curb.</p>
<p class="pinkFont">Average truck driver salary is $28.69 an hour.  At that salary a man or woman requires regular hours or families suffer.  A bump in salary would end Americas' trucker shortage overnight.  Capitalism does not want to do that.  Capitalism wants to enlarge the labor pool to keep wages down.  And $28.69 is a fabulous wage for an 18, 19 or 20-year-old that does not have a family.</p>
<p class="pinkFont">Lowering the age requirements for interstate trucking greatly broadens the talent pool. It becomes possible for 18-year-old high school graduates to choose a career in truck driving without waiting until the age of 21.</p>
<p class="pinkFont">The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, reports drivers under the age of 20 are three times more likely to be in a fatal crash. Safety groups are opposed to allowing 20 year-olds as drivers of 20-ton trucks.  They are strongly opposed.  I opine that 18 19 and 20-year-olds can unload trucks like I am doing now.  Have fun, build some character and polish the frontal lobes when you are 18, 19, or 20.  Those frontal lobes need some work.</p>
<p class="pinkFont">The wheels of trucks will turn as long as there is oil to turn trucking wheels.  America turns trucking wheels by paying low wages.  That is what people America votes into power do to keep profits to owners high.  They keep wages low.</p>
<p class="pinkFont">The trucking industry outspends safety groups arguing for improved conditions for truck drivers.  Capitalism is firmly in bipartisan control.  Public safety ignored.  Wages accounting for loading times, delays, and weather issues are not what the owning class wants to pay.  Strong unions would make Americas' trucking shortage go away.  But America does not do unions anymore, and America will soon forget what unions are as unions go extinct.</p>
<p class="pinkFont">Truckers are workers in the fossil fuel distribution system of modern life.  Truckers do not own the system.  Owners of the distribution system in which truckers are a part, like a gear in a machine, control how the distribution system works.  Money owners make from surplus value controls political power, which then administers the system to owner benefit.</p>
<p class="pinkFont">Over time, the number of owners shrinks and the number of owned grows.  Power concentrates to a small group of unaccountable people.  Their actions directed to make owners more money.  Social gain, social health, and preservation of the experiment of civilization is no concern to this small number of people who decide what people should do and how much they should be paid.  The goal of all their action is to reap surplus value generated from what is owned.</p>
<p class="pinkFont">This is the world I live in.  Most Americans can't imagine living any other way, and they can't imagine any need to change the way Americans live.</p>
<p class="pinkFont">As if oil would last forever, and as if the Earth were not beginning to be hostile to human life as it warms.</p>
<p class="pinkFont">* <i>In reality truckers may work many more hours than 40 in a week and the $28.69 assumes a 40 hour week.  Making the pay not as sweet as it seems.</i></p>

<p class="oliveFont">Money is not going to go away anytime soon.  If money goes away you won't be reading this.  There are people on earth who can live without money.  People like the Sentinelese of North Sentinel Island in the Indian Ocean.  The Sentenelese attack approaching boats and live in voluntary paleolithic isolation.  They kill people who try to contact them.</p>
<p class="oliveFont">People living without money total only a few hundred on the whole earth.  Everyone else lives on the earth where money touches their lives every day.  Money changes the kind of people we are.  Money touches the lives of billions and money will be in your life every day you are alive.</p>
<p class="oliveFont">CapitalISM sucks, but in a pure socialist utopian dream, people still must be paid to work.  People remain flawed, regardless of their particular 'ism'. Food must be bought, rent must be paid for.</p>
<p class="oliveFont">Some people like a free ride, and they won't work unless they have to.  On a basic level, viewed from far enough away, things may look the same regardless of the particular 'ism' that rules your day.  Viewed up close differences are seen.</p>
<p class="oliveFont">In any 'ism', to make sure enough people behave responsibly, to make sure lights are on with electricity left over for video games, people must be paid for work.  Without pay, people won't work.  The exceptions are few.</p>
<p class="oliveFont">The 'ism' of servitude you live under may look the same at a far enough distance away as other possible 'ism's you could live under.  But I would not be a socialist if I did not think the 'ism' ruling your day did not matter.  Fascism, capitalism, socialism, or whatever the 'ism'.  Not every 'ism' is the same.  Not all 'ism's provides for everyones' basic needs and providing for basic needs is important.  The yawning and growing chasm of income disparity of AmericanISM allows far to many too live in misery, or as fools.  Having lived as a fool, I know about such things.</p>
<p class="oliveFont">Modern people can't meet any of life's basic needs without money.  People without jobs must be given money by others because without money to satisfy basic needs you die.  Traditionally, the way people who have trouble meeting their basic needs survive, is through family and personal connections who help them.  This is how it is across the world.</p>
<p class="oliveFont">Today I went to a coffeeshop where I am known.  Don, a local artist, saw me go in the door, followed me in, saying he came in to talk to me.  That was a nice thing for Don to do.  Don is a good painter.  I hope he gets discovered, but as things are these days people do not buy a lot of art.</p>
<p class="oliveFont">Don told me about a 'lying down' movement in China.  He said to 'look it up on the internet', so I did.  </p>
<p class="oliveFont">"<i><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://www.thelist.com/726476/why-the-lie-flat-movement-is-causing-a-stir-in-china/?utm_campaign=clip">A movement </a>that is growing in popularity in China is something called tang ping, which the South China Morning Post says translates to mean "lie flat." No, this is not some kind of yoga pose, but rather a philosophy that says there's no need to keep on working as hard as you can when there's so little reward to be gained from doing so. Instead, those who embrace the lie flat philosophy opt for doing the minimum amount of work needed in order just to scrape by."</i></p>
<p class="oliveFont">This seems good to me.  But I see agreement about the 'minimum amount' of work as a problem.  Some people would like their minimum to be zero.  Of this I have no doubt.</p>
<p class="oliveFont">The tang ping movement rebels against the long Chinese work week.  In China a '996' work culture causes people to work themselves to death.  A 996 office schedule -- 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., six days a week, plus overtime can be fatal.</p>
<p class="oliveFont">Chinese President Xi Jinping responding to tang ping or 'lie flat' said: "<i>Form an environment for improvement in which everyone participates, avoiding involution and lying flat." He did say that they should avoid the "trap of welfarism" so the wealthy didn't have to support the "lazy" poor.</i>"  (This comes from a South Chinese Morning Post translation.)</p>
<p class="oliveFont">How do you put down a protest movement where millions of people simply stay home and do nothing?  I will guess censorship of 'lie flat' will be the answer.</p>
<p class="oliveFont">To me a reasonable minimum effort is living within your means, with reasonable efforts to meet your needs.  If you are physically able to make reasonable efforts.</p>
<p class="oliveFont">If you can't work because of a disability your burdens are heavy.  For you I hope the 'ism' you have to endure provides for basic needs.  Like medical care.</p>

<p class="greenFont">It is another week of social seclusion for me.  Getting to the job on time. Going home to cultivate order in my personal life.  Becoming the person I want to be.</p>
<p class="greenFont">I ache, exhausted by physical labor, but I am strong and steady.  I ache from gain.  There is nothing to complain about.</p>
<p class="greenFont">I glance at the news and see I miss nothing by concentrating only on my own affairs.  Propaganda to shape attitudes about the potential Russian invasion of the Donbass Oblasts fills American news.  American media paints the situation as Russian aggression against Ukraine, and YouTube blocks channels belonging to the Donetsk and Luhansk people’s breakaway republics.</p>
<p class="greenFont">America is not aware that Ukraine has been in a civil war since 2014 and a Russian invasion is claimed justified by Russia moving to protect Russian Citizens.  I hope whatever happens in Donbass happens without the world turning into a radioactive ashtray.  With the claim that Russia will use fake video as pretense for invading Ukraine, wartime censorship comes to America.  YouTube does as directed.  The doomsday clock clicks toward ashtray.  Aggression is out of control.  Drones fall in Syria.</p>
<p class="greenFont">Climate storms are ahead.  Americans are impoverished.  The rich and stupid want war.  Things do not look good.  It is a good time to appreciate what you have.  A good time to think of the wise Turk at the end of Voltaire's Candide who said:</p>
<p class="greenFont"><i> ‘I have only twenty acres,’ replied the old man; ‘I and my children cultivate them; and our labour preserves us from three great evils: weariness, vice, and want.’ Candide, on his way home, reflected deeply on what the old man had said. ‘This honest Turk,’ he said to Pangloss and Martin, ‘seems to be in a far better place than kings…. I also know,” said Candide, “that we must cultivate our garden.’ ‘I have only twenty acres,’ replied the old man; ‘I and my children cultivate them; and our labour preserves us from three great evils: weariness, vice, and want.’ Candide, on his way home, reflected deeply on what the old man had said. ‘This honest Turk,’ he said to Pangloss and Martin, ‘seems to be in a far better place than kings…. I also know,” said Candide, “that we must cultivate our garden.’</i></p>
<p class="greenFont">Or ‘we must grow our vegetables’, ‘we must tend to our lands’ or ‘we need to work our fields’.  In the language of the American consumer, all we are left with is, 'we must take care of our own shit'.</p>
<p class="greenFont">Ignore the bullshit that screens everywhere assault you with.  Pay attention only to what you choose.</p>
<p class="greenFont">Today I enjoy being alive.  If I am alive tomorrow, I will feel the same.  I will not pay attention to things I can't control.  My day will end and I will not waste time. Awareness of reality in America continues a long winter nap.  Sleeping dogs are best left alone.</p>

<p class="monarchFont">January 28th, 2022</p>
<p class="monarchFont">I wrote I wasn't sure what my hobbyhorse was recently.  But for me, not having a hobbyhorse is a temporary condition.  I am not wired to live without purpose.  I get restless without a goal, and this week I find new outrage.  Proof social media cultivates American hate.  I'll write about this in a future blog, but not today.</p>
<p class="monarchFont">* This <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="text-decoration: none;" class="redFont" href="https://www.takimag.com/article/the-great-divorce/">article</a> rhymes with my discovery.  The connection is social media.  I find the article amusing, but do not agree with all content.</p>
<p class="monarchFont">My focus today is as local as it gets, my own life.  My new job grounds me and gives me a center.  I also feel driven into the ground by it, by the exertion.  Muscles I never knew I had hurt.  In three weeks my strength is doubled, but pain comes with that gain.  Pain that becomes a warm glow as it goes away, but it takes days before ripped muscles stop complaining.  The pain gives me a chuckle because I know it is a good pain to have.  Pain of growth.  I am moving my body, eating well, and getting healthy.  I am stronger and feel more alive.  I notice small things in life that were passing me by.  I am present and alert in my life. I endeavor to clean rooms and organize.</p>
<p class="monarchFont">Having clean rooms is a nod to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="text-decoration: none;" class="redFont" href="https://bigthink.com/neuropsych/jordan-peterson-clean-your-room/">Jordan Peterson.</a>  Jordan is a thoughtful, intelligent man.  But I never know if Jordan is serving up an intellectual gourmet meal or if Jordan panders mental fast food.  Such is the danger in trying to be an expert in all things.</p>
<p class="monarchFont">Clean your room is good advice.  Jordan does a poor job explaining why.  Jordan's view is young people don't know anything.  Jordan thinks young people don't have the life experience to understand complex issues.  This is insulting.  Innocence can see through bullshit sometimes.  I have seen innocence see through bullshit many times in my life.  Jordan tells you to clean your room, but he does not know how dirty your room is.   Jordan has not seen your room.  How clean is Jordan's own room?  “And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?”  Jordan is big on the bible.</p>
<p class="monarchFont">Ground yourself in reality.  Clean up your own life.  Understanding issues that are outside of and bigger than you will be easier if your own life is not in a mess.  That is the point, and it should be an obvious point, but it is a point we ignore.  We ignore it because we want to.</p>
<p class="monarchFont">But being told you can't have an opinion without having an organized life is a horrible thing to hear.  Who is the judge?  Jordan's advice is not without a dark side.</p>
<p class="monarchFont">Americans are isolated islands in a vast sea of technology.  That is going to be the American way until petroleum runs out.  Social connections are filtered, lost, and broken.  Life is a struggle, satisfaction is elusive.  Jordan Peterson's way out of this mess is start by cleaning your room.  It is good advice to have clean rooms.  Knowing how to clean and cleaning is an essential life skill I agree. But let us not have another divisive category to drive people apart with.  We have more than enough divisive categories already without having to know who has a clean room and who does not.  </p>
<p class="monarchFont">Having a clean room is not going to meet any social need.  Your craving for other people is not satisfied by having a clean room.  Sometimes people with messy rooms have good things to say.</p>
<p class="monarchFont">The more intelligent a man becomes, the less he or she knows that he or she knows.  Knowledge comes from an infinite sea, is why.  Take some knowledge from the vast sea, and you become aware of the infinity you do not know.  There is always more you don't know than you can ever know.  No place to draw a line in the sea to say if a man is ignorant or not.  Infinity is everywhere the same.  That we are all ignorant is the truth we know.  Jordan Peterson seems to forget this and thinks having a clean room is magical.  It is not magical, but it is good to have.</p>
<p class="monarchFont">Work on your own life first.  Do not neglect it.  Your own life is what you control.  This is my take-away from Jordan's advice.  If you can control something outside of yourself and the control can make goodness, do it.  Do not wait to have a clean room to show kindness to the world.  Clean your room, so you can control more, yes.  Clean so you know what it is you can control and what you can't.</p>
<p class="monarchFont">Don't wait until rooms are clean to show the world kindness.  A look at the news shows chaos and madness everywhere.  If there is something you can do to make some madness go away, do it.  We have enough apathy and isolation.  We need more than clean rooms, and we do not have time for spotless.</p>

<p class="wheatFont">The job goes well. I get to work on time.  I keep myself on task through my shift.  I focus on my work. I cooperate with my coworkers.  I make an effort to remember their names.  It is no mystery things are going well for me.</p>
<p class="wheatFont">I am committed to giving my best. A sustained, steady pace.  Render unto Caesar.  At the end of the shift, I am a free man with more coin than I had starting.  Coin to keep my family more secure than when I went to work.</p>
<p class="wheatFont">Things are not going well for one young man in his mid 20's who started work the same day I did. I will call him 'V'. He was let go. I sadly agree with the decision. 'V' came to work drunk less than two weeks after starting the job. This is his story.</p>
<p class="wheatFont">I was stocking shelves when 'V' showed up.  He was late.  Something to do with bus connections he said.  It was my sixth day working the new job.</p>
<p class="wheatFont">Stocking shelves in the retail store connected to the warehouse.  Walls and isles are full of things to be sold.  Finding where to put things is difficult.  How fast I learn where everything goes surprises me, but it is all new.  Working a warehouse with about 50,000 different items takes a fully occupied brain.  Six days in Albert Einstein would think so.  I want to be productive and feel like I earn my keep.  The only way I can do that is by fully concentrating on my task.</p>
<p class="wheatFont">The store is closed.  The only people in the store are employees.  Our supervisor 'A' shows up at the end of the isle I am working with 'V' by his side.  'A' said, Keith will show you what to do.  I found this odd as 'V' and I were both new.  Having a new employee show another new employee what to do is a bit strange.</p>
<p class="wheatFont">I showed 'V' what I was doing, and he had trouble understanding.  It was a simple task and there should have been no trouble.  'V' sensing this, quietly said to me.  "Man I am loaded".  Saying this as he bumped against a cart of items from the warehouse, almost falling over.</p>
<p class="wheatFont">I suppressed my thought of "fuck you", and said "Man don't do that.  I won't tell anyone, but that is not cool."  'V' replied back, "This is just a job."  I replied.  "Yes this is just a job but this is your job."  Then to stop him from responding I said pointing with a finger,  "Hand me that box".</p>
<p class="wheatFont">'V' slowed me down.  I would have been better off working alone.  Before the shift was over, I told 'V'.  "Don't come to work drunk tomorrow.  We have a truck to unload."  'V' replied. "this is just a job."</p>
<p class="wheatFont">My lack of reprimand substituting an appeal to 'V's social side may have paid off.  When the crew started work the next day, 'V' appeared sober, even a bit chipper.  But as we began walking to the warehouse, 'A' said to 'V', "come with me".  They went off in the direction of the store office.</p>
<p class="wheatFont">Halfway through the shift 'M' who works with me a lot said, "I have not seen 'V' tonight. I wonder what he is doing."</p>
<p class="wheatFont">I said I was not surprised.  I told 'M' that 'A' had taken 'V' into the office at the start of the shift.  I said that 'V' had shown up loaded the night before and that I was sure 'A' had noticed.  I said this knowing in my gut there was no confidence to be kept any longer.</p>
<p class="wheatFont">Later as we were going on break, we are all together.  'A' turned around in front of us and said, "I don't think 'V' will be working with us again.  He came in drunk last night, and he takes smoke breaks whenever he wants to.  I don't think he is a good fit for our team."</p>
<p class="wheatFont">"Look you guys, I don't care what you do,  You can drop acid for all I care, but you can't let me find out about it or I have to do my job.  I had to send 'V' home.  Corporate will call him tomorrow."</p>
<p class="wheatFont">I quipped "I went to work on acid once".  Quickly realizing what I had said, I added, "but that was after I dropped and it was on my day off.  It was my first day off in thirty days and they called me in."</p>
<p class="wheatFont">This is a true story.  It was my first day off in thirty days, working in a gas station at $4.10 an hour.  I had taken a tab of blotter five minute before the phone rang.  If I could do it all over again I would not have answered the phone.  The surprising thing is at the end of the day after the pavement stopped melting, I still had a job.  At the time I was 'V's age.</p>
<p class="wheatFont">Later 'M' said to me.  "You know, 'V' could be back.  We have had a lot of people who had rocky starts and some of them were able to pull it together and they stayed here for quite a while."  I replied, "but not less than two weeks into the job with a bad attitude."  If corporate tries to give 'V'' a second chance he will blow it.</p>
<p class="wheatFont">Writing this I wish 'V' had been given a second chance.  Alcohol was ruining my life in my early 20's.  I stopped drinking and started living sober.  It was one of my better life decisions.  I had noticed drinkers get old fast and die young.</p>
<p class="wheatFont">It would have been nice to help 'V' get off the struggle bus if I could have.  I hope 'V' realizes his life will be better if he gets off the struggle bus.  Stand up, pull the cord, and get off at the next stop.  Step into a new life.  If any readers here are on a struggle bus, and there are many different kinds of struggle bus, get off.  The sooner the better.  Find the courage to make the change.  Step into a new life.  Rewards for your effort may be slow in coming, but rewards there will be!</p>

<p class="pinkFont">January 14th, 2022</p>
<p class="pinkFont">Four days this week seven days in so far.  Humping boxeswith steel items inside. Some are heavy.  I was not asked if I could lift fifty pounds.  I was asked if can I heft sixty.</p>
<p class="pinkFont">I get to know the men I am working with slowly.  The work comes first.  It will take a while for me to see where the other men are in their lives.  We focus on production.  I do as much as I can in a shift.</p>
<p class="pinkFont">Only men unload our trucks.  Our average height is above six feet.  I am three inches more than that.  One older man bumps seventy years old.  He does not need glasses.  Somebody should study his genes.</p>
<p class="pinkFont">As if the world will last long enough for that to matter.</p>
<p class="pinkFont">Now I have three days off.  I will spend all the money I have made.  But that is Ok. I am spending the money to make my wife fall in love with me if I can.  We are married forty two years tomorrow.</p>
<p class="pinkFont">Daily life has kept me off the internet for a while and I do not mind.  Checking climate news Argentina is running a temperature.  For a little while Argentina is the hottest place on the planet.  There is a cacophony of extreme weather everywhere.</p>
<p class="pinkFont">Today I think of where my life is going. The Supreme Court blockage of The vaccine mandate pisses me off.  I am vaxed and expect the men I work with are vaxed.  Less harm is my guiding principle, and thou shall not kill.  But my concern with people being vaxed can only go so far when people don't cooperate.  I care to control only what I can.  What I am doing in my own life is what is on my mind.  My own actions are all I control.</p>
<p class="pinkFont">I blog and so do a million other people.  Every blogger has a hobby-horse.  But right now I am not sure what my hobby-horse is.</p>
<p class="pinkFont">Doom and the depletion of petroleum once meant a lot to me.  Now after decades of sustained ignorance and a brainwashed society.  I know social collapse is going to happen.  Nobody cares enough to stop it and life is going to return to what it was before the petroleum age.  Before overpopulation ate up the earth.</p>
<p class="pinkFont">All I can do until the end is live a good life.  Good to others and myself.</p>
<p class="pinkFont">Doom has always shadowed humanity.  People lived on the edge of extinction for hundreds of thousands of years is my opinion.  Big brains cultivated by the ebb and flow of the constant threat of extinction.  Bigger brains favored survival.  When I think about things in this way, the American notion of endless prosperity is absurd.</p>
<p class="pinkFont">I was damaged by a belief in an American sci-fi future when I was young.  Science would lead to endless prosperity.  But belief in endless prosperity put people into dreams.  The belief in sci-fi is no threat to things the way they already are.  It is hard to criticize the temporary.  Sci-fi popularity is guaranteed.  Brain numbing begins at an early age.  Sci-fi is big in children's toys. Now sci-fi lives on in dreams of a green renewable future.  A childish dream.  A future rendered impossible by overpopulation, technical limits and math. Real technology can't measure up to sci-fi fantasy magic.  Laws of the universe interfere.</p>
<p class="pinkFont">In theory people could change lifestyles but covid shows that is not going to happen.  People a year ago who social distanced to the inch and masked up, lost their shit this Christmas.  The mental strain of everyday sameness was too much and covid infections surged.  Collective insanity has seized the day.  The second round of the Christmas surge is starting.  There is a possibility I am exposed.  My paws are crossed as I mask up.</p>
<p class="pinkFont">People are going to rebel against imposed limits, no matter how well the intention of the limits.  Doom baked in the cake by rebellion.  It seems to be a law of human nature that transgression is exciting.  Danger ignored.</p>
<p class="pinkFont">Belief in a sci-fi future damages you when reality crashes sci-fi dreams.  Only in an age of excess energy could sci-fi dreams ever be believed by so many.  Yet nature has limits.  Math says resources are going away.  There will be a crash, but nobody wants to believe it.</p>

<p class="oliveFont">January 7th, 2022</p>
<p class="oliveFont">Thank you, Kim, for buying me coffee.  As part of my thanks, I am not dogging out of writing here today.  My publisher (me) wants me to put something out once a week, on Friday.  But I was tempted to dog out, conflicted.  Your donation gives me an obligation that a tired body was tempted to ignore. Instead of buying me a coffee, perhaps buying me a microwave lunch is more appropriate for todays' reading.  The lunch was good.  Beans and beef, thanks.</p>
<p class="oliveFont">I thought to ignore writing here because of my proletariat part-time gig.  I worked three days this week in a warehouse.  My body is in shock.  People moving things by hand is still a thing. I was plugged into the internet like 'Neo' was plugged into the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="text-decoration: none;" class="redFont" href="https://www.matrixfans.net/">Matrix</a> before Neo was pilled.  Before I went to work.  When Neo unplugged, his body started moving for the first time.  My Covid planted dead ass has hardly moved in two years.  A bit of an exaggeration.  I have a garden.  But everybody who should be cleaning their house right now knows what I am talking about. I have taken the red pill.</p>
<p class="oliveFont">My red pill shock is bearable.  There is pain, but my body also feels good at the same time.  My body knows I am doing a good thing.  My conflicted brain is beginning to know that I am doing a good thing, too.  It has extra oxygen, and living the life of a wage slave for only three days has put things in front of my eyes to think about I would not otherwise see.  All this in short time.  I can feel everything working better.</p>
<p class="oliveFont">Inequality is apparent.  I watch internet videos about what people get paid and support the $15 minimum wage movement.  I have for a long time.  Whoopie do do!! Good 4 me.  (Sarcasm off).  Now I go to work.  I take something to microwave on the lunch break.  Looking at my fuel gauge on the way I stop for gas.  The numbers mean something different to me as they roll up now.  Before reaching work I stop for a bite to eat.  I look at how much money the food and gas all adds up to.  I think of how much of my work shift needs to pay for all this before my day sees any profit.  Before, my shift of humping is worth doing.  I do not like the clock in my mind my spending makes me see, and I am getting more than the current holy grail of $15 an hour.</p>
<p class="oliveFont">I can't do much about my fuel cost.  Without public transportation, I must drive.  11 miles each way.  Careful shopping will cut the wage slave diet cost by a third or better.  Lunch on the way is Ok, but I should try and eat where I sleep before work.  That is what wage slaves really do.  Lunch on the way is Ok because I am not flat-assed broke like most wage slaves in America are.</p>
<p class="oliveFont">My part-time job is an instant change in perspective.  Change in perspective is good and something we need.  I am convincing myself that busting my hump is a good thing as I type.  This shows how crazy I am.  We are all crazy.  Every one of us, and we need the real world to ground us.  The basic human condition is to be crazy.</p>
<p class="oliveFont">We use and we are used by technology.  Complicated things run our lives.  So involved in complexity, we can't see beyond the boundaries' technology makes.  Boundaries that we make for ourselves as we get on with life.</p>
<p class="oliveFont">So I had been supporting a $15 dollar minimum wage, but I'm feeling $20 now.</p>
<p class="oliveFont">From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs.  Ability can and often is a personal issue.  Needs everyone has.  America is not meeting the needs of its people.  Housing cost make everyone without a home homeless now.  Housing cost goes forever up.  Luck rarely makes a person rich, and hard work is doing no better.  To buy a home in America, you need to be rich.  Wage slaves are condemned to be poor.  Food is not cheap in America like it used to be.  Wage slaves cannot save their way out of their circumstances, and now their diet suffers.</p>
<p class="oliveFont">Everything seems to be coming apart.  Wage slaves have a hard time in America.  In Europe, there is a specter of war.  UK natural gas cost has soared by 500 per cent in a year, giving UK slaves a hard time.  Low exports of natural gas from Russia contribute.  There is trouble in Donbass.  All those things are happening far away from where I am.  I have my own problems.  But it makes me wonder which way the wind blows.</p>
<p class="oliveFont">I will get my schedule for next week today.  Some days off I requested are approved.  I learned how to use my fingerprint on a time clock yesterday.  My proletarian experiment continues.  Life through the eyes of a worker.  I have not had this kind of job since high school.  Unlike a trapped wage slave, I intend to change what I am doing in six months.  As an at will wage slave, it is up to me.  It seems a good amount of time to learn some stoic lessons.  Chisel some gentile giant character.  I can lift things I have to move without hurting myself if I am smart.  If I am careless, I will hurt myself.  I will be smart.  Young strong men have my back.</p>
<p class="oliveFont">I have been too busy dealing with snow and ice to wonder what climate change is doing.  I hope everybody has a good week.</p>
